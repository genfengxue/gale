Don't worry. The traffic is very heavy at this hour.(01--2)
I know. But we're going to be late for dinner.(01--2)
I'll take this green sweater.(01--2)
I like the color on me, don't you?(01--2)
I think it looks terrific on you.(01--2)
I'm sorry I'm so late.(01--2)
I had a really bad day.(01--2)
It's ten after six. We're late.(01--2)
Robbie's cooking tonight, and dinner's at six thirty.(01--2)
I know. I know. I'm really sorry.(01--2)
I left my bag of film on the ferry.(01--2)
I went back for it, but the ferry was gone.(01--2)
I lost a whole day's work.(01--2)

And give her a teaspoon of the medicine after every meal.(01--3)
You're welcome. Good-bye.(01--3)
How are you?(01--3)
Don't worry. She'll be fine.(01--3)

Oh, I'd love some ice cream.(01--3)
Well, there's chocolate and coffee and a little vanilla.(01--3)
I'll have vanilla.(01--3)
Is that all right with everyone?(01--3)
I'll have chocolate.(01--3)
Me, too.(01--3)
Uh, one scoop of coffee(01--3)
and one scoop of chocolate for me.(01--3)
Robbie, will you help me serve?(01--3)
I keep thinking about that bag of film. Eight rolls.(01--3)
A whole day's work.(01--3)
And good stuff, too.(01--3)
Don't worry, Richard.(01--3)
Somenoe will find it.(01--3)
I'll get it.(01--3)
Hello.(01--3)
Does Richard Stewart live here?(01--3)
Yes, he's my brother.(01--3)
I'm Robbie...Robbie Stewart.(01--3)
I'm Alexandra Pappas.(01--3)
How do you do?(01--3)
Your brother left his bag of film on the ferryboat.(01--3)
I found it.(01--3)
I'm really glad to see you.(01--3)
I mean...my brother'll be really glad to see you!(01--3)

It's nice to meet you.(01--3)
And this is my mother, Ellen Stewart.(01--3)
How do you do?(01--3)
And my father, Dr. Philip Stewart.(01--3)
Nice to meet you, Alexandra.(01--3)
And...ah...you met Robbie.(01--3)
Yes. And you must be Susan. Hi.(01--3)
Hi. Welcome.(01--3)
I'm so glad you found the bag(01--3)
and took the time and trouble to return it.(01--3)
Oh, it was no trouble.(01--3)
I just took the wrong train.(01--3)
Would you like something to eat?(01--3)
Thank you, no.(01--3)
I'm late for dinner at my house.(01--3)
I really have to go.(01--3)
Would you like to call home?(01--3)
I'd appreciate that.(01--3)
Please, use the phone.(01--3)
Thanks. Excuse me.(01--3)
Alexandra's a high-school exchange student from Greece.(01--3)

With a family in the Bronx.(01--3)
Oh, that's not too far from here!(01--3)

Have some iced tea.(01--3)

Would you like some pasta?(01--3)
I made it myself.(01--3)
It might be a little cold.(01--3)
Thanks, no. I do have to go.(01--3)
It was nice meeting you all.(01--3)
Well, maybe you'll come for lunch some Sunday,(01--3)
so we can really thank you(01--3)
for bringing Richard's bag back.(01--3)
Maybe.(01--3)
You're welcome anytime.(01--3)
Good-bye.(01--3)
Can I drive you home?(01--3)
No, thanks.(01--3)
The train is just up the street.(01--3)
It won't take me long at all.(01--3)
Well, you really saved the day for me, Alexandra.(01--3)
Bye.(01--3)
Bye-bye.(01--3)
Good night.(01--3)
She's a smart young lady, and very nice.(01--3)
Very! Hey, she forgot her bag!(01--3)
I guess we'll be seeing Alexandra again.(01--3)
Right, Robbie?(01--3)
Excuse me. Can you help me?(02--1)
Sure, what do you want?(02--1)
Where is 83 Wooster Street?(02--1)
That's easy. Walk to the corner.(02--1)
Then make a left turn.(02--1)
Then walk two blocks to the traffic light.(02--1)
Make another left to Wooster.(02--1)
Thank you.(02--1)
To the corner and then a left?(02--1)
Yeah. A left.(02--1)
Hot dog? Only seventy-five cents.(02--1)
No. Thank you. I have a dinner date.(02--1)

Try again.(02--1)

Hello, Harry. It's nice to meet you.(02--1)
Nice to meet you, Susan.(02--1)
Sorry I'm late.(02--1)
The traffic. The parking. I was lost.(02--1)
What pretty flowers! Thank you.(02--1)
Oh, please come in.(02--1)
Don't worry about being late. It's fine.(02--1)
Excuse the mess. I just moved here.(02--1)
Oh, I'd like you to meet my sister-in-law Marilyn.(02--1)
Marilyn Stewart, this is Harry Bennett.(02--1)
Pleased to meet you.(02--1)
Nice to meet you, Harry.(02--1)
Are we too late for our dinner reservation?(02--1)

I'll get the rest of the dinner.(02--2)
Excuse me.(02--2)
Please forgive me, Susan, but...(02--2)
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...(02--2)
What's the matter?(02--2)
My daughter isn't feeling well.(02--2)
Oh no! Is it serious?(02--2)
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,(02--2)
and she's crying.(02--2)
I'll have to go home.(02--2)
Will you forgive me?(02--2)
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.(02--2)
And you didn't have a chance to eat.(02--2)
Oh, it's OK.(02--2)
Let me take you home first.(02--2)
No, no. Please, go ahead.(02--2)
It's our first date.(02--2)
We'll make another.(02--2)
Please don't worry.(02--2)
I'll phone you.(02--2)
I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.(02--2)
What happened?(02--3)
The baby-sitter called.(02--3)
His daughter is sick.(02--3)
What's wrong?(02--3)
I think she has a stomachache.(02--3)
He's a good father.(02--3)
So... what do you think of him?(02--3)
He's very nice.(02--3)
But I think he was nervous tonight.(02--3)
It was his first date in two years.(02--3)
Will you see him again?(02--3)
I hope so.(02--3)
This food is delicious.(02--3)
He didn't get a thing to eat.(02--3)
You ordered enough for three or four people,(02--3)
but I'm not complaining.(02--3)
The food is delicious.(02--3)
Who is that? (02--3)
Do you think it's...(02--3)
No.(02--3)
You won't believe it, Marilyn!(02--3)
I believe it. Even without looking.(02--3)
Hi!(02--3)
How...?(02--3)
Your downstairs neighbor let me in.(02--3)
Did you go home?(02--3)
I did , but everything is OK,(02--3)
so I decided to come back.(02--3)
To apologize for leaving so early,(02--3)
I brought you a little gift.(02--3)
It's a bonsai tree for your new apartment. (02--3)
Hi, Marilyn. I hope it's not too late.(02--3)
Oh, not at all. We're still eating.(02--3)
Please, come in. Join us.(02--3)
It's our meal from the restaurant.(02--3)
And how is your daughter?(02--3)
Oh, she's fine. It was only a tummy ache.(02--3)
It's good that you went back.(02--3)
Yes, I think it's important for me to be there(02--3)
since her mother died.(02--3)
I agree. Aren't you hungry?(02--3)
As a matter of fact... I am hungry.(02--3)
There's lots of food left.(02--3)
Mmm, this is delicious!(02--3)
Enjoy!(02--3)
I'm going to excuse myself.(02--3)
I have a lot of work to do to get ready for tomorrow.(02--3)
Good night, Harry. It was nice meeting you.(02--3)
Bye, Marilyn.(02--3)
Good night, Susan.(02--3)
Good night, Marilyn.(02--3)
She's going to a fashion show here in the city tomorrow.(02--3)
She is sleeping here(02--3)
so she won't have to travel from Riverdale in the morning.(02--3)
You two must be close.(02--3)
we are.(02--3)
The whole Stewart family is close.(02--3)
I like that.(02--3)
And then, two years ago, my wife died.(02--3)
You miss her.(02--3)
I do...yes, but I have Michelle...(02--3)
and with time...(02--3)
Is there anyone else in your life?(02--3)
No, not yet. What about you?(02--3)
Oh, I date occasionally,(02--3)
but my work keeps me busy.(02--3)
Ooh, speaking of keeping busy-(02--3)
I have an early start tomorrow,(02--3)
and the baby-sitter has to get home.(02--3)
Where did the time go?(02--3)
It's midnight.(02--3)
Thank you, Susan.(02--3)
I had a nice evening.(02--3)
Me, too, Harry.(02--3)
Harry?(02--3)
Yes?(02--3)
I'd like to meet your daughter someday.(02--3)
Does that mean that I can see you again?(02--3)
Of course.(02--3)
Wonderful. I'll call you,(02--3)
and we'll go out to dinner.(02--3)
Please do.(02--3)
I promise I won't leave early.(02--3)
It was for a good reason.(02--3)
You know something?(02--3)
What?(02--3)
I think we're going to be good friends.(02--3)
Good night, Susan.(02--3)
Good night, Harry,(02--3)
Have a safe trip home.(02--3)
Are you all right?(02--3)
Sorry.(02--3)
I never liked that umbrella stand.(02--3)
Good night, Harry.(02--3)
Marilyn, you want coffee or tea?(03--1)
Coffee, please.(03--1)
I am so excited!(03--1)
At this time tomorrow morning,(03--1)
Grandpa will be sitting in the kitchen with us.(03--1)
When does he arrive?(03--1)
At six o'clock this evening.(03--1)
By plane?(03--1)
No, by train.(03--1)
Are we picking him up at the station?(03--1)
Not Grandpa.(03--1)
He doesn't want anybody picking him up.(03--1)
He likes to be independent.(03--1)
Oh, let's go upstairs and prepare Grandpa's room.(03--1)
Great! Let's do it!(03--1)
Good morning, Mom.(03--1)
Morning.(03--1)
Well, hi, fellas.(03--1)
Hello.(03--1)
Hi, honey.(03--1)
Morning, Marilyn.(03--1)
We are going upstairs to set up Grandpa's room.(03--1)
There's coffee ready.(03--1)
I'm really excited about seeing Grandpa.(03--1)
Me, too. Milk, please.(03--1)
He's so funny.(03--1)
He always makes me laugh.(03--1)
I hope Grandpa's going to like living with us.(03--1)
I think he will.(03--1)
It just takes time to feel comfortable in a new place.(03--1)
Won't he miss being in Florida?(03--1)
Well, he will.(03--1)
But I think he'll like being here with the family.(03--1)
Are you sure about that?(03--1)
It's crazy here most of the time.(03--1)
But it's fun.(03--1)
That's for sure.(03--1)
You know,(03--1)
maybe I'll put together some photos of Grandpa(03--1)
as a "welcome" present.(03--1)
That's a neat idea.(03--1)
What can I do?(03--1)
I've got it! (03--1)
I have a picture of Grandpa and Dad and me in my wallet.(03--1)
It's from the Fathers and Sons' Breakfast(03--1)
at my junior high school graduation.(03--1)
Oh, I remember this picture.(03--1)
I'd really like to pick up Grandpa at the railroad station.(03--1)
Railroad stations or airports--(03--1)
Grandpa always tells us he'll get here by himself.(03--1)
He's something!(03--1)
Is this all Grandpa's stuff?(03--1)
That's it.(03--1)
But I'm sure he has a few bags with him on the train.(03--1)
What's inside?(03--1)
I don't know. It's locked.(03--1)
Hi.(03--1)
Oh, hi, darling.(03--1)
Morning, Philip.(03--1)
I want to put some of my good hangers in Grandpa's closet.(03--1)
You know I'm very excited about his arrival.(03--1)
We are, too.(03--1)
Susan called early this morning.(03--1)
She's unhappy(03--1)
because she's had to go to Chicago on a business trip(03--1)
and can't leave till tonight.(03--1)
She wants to be here for Grandpa.(03--1)
Well, Grandpa will be disappointed, too.(03--1)
He loves Susan.(03--1)
She always reminds him of Grandma.(03--1)
Well, how's everything here?(03--1)
Fine. We were just wondering about this trunk.(03--1)
It's locked.(03--1)
Oh. I have the key. Grandpa sent it to me.(03--1)
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?(03--2)
No, it's not taken.(03--2)
Oh, thank you.(03--2)
Oh, let me help you with this.(03--2)
Oh, thank you.(03--2)
Do you want to sit by the window?(03--2)
No, no, no. I like the aisle seat better.(03--2)
Please, you sit by the window.(03--2)
My name is Stewart... Malcolm Stewart.(03--2)
Pleased to meet you.(03--2)
I'm Elsa Tobin. How do you do?(03--2)
Do you live in New York?(03--2)
No, no. I'm from Florida.(03--2)
I am, too. But didn't you just get on?(03--2)
No, no. I just changed my seat.(03--2)
A man next to me was smoking,(03--2)
and smoke really bothers me.(03--2)
Where are you from in Florida?(03--2)
Titusville. It's near Orlando.(03--2)
Small world. I'm from Titusville, too.(03--2)
Really? What part?(03--2)
My husband and I live near Spaceport.(03--2)
I know that area.(03--2)
My house is only a few miles from Spaceport.(03--2)
Do you still live there?(03--2)
Oh yes, yes. My husband's there now.(03--2)
He couldn't take time off to come to New York with me.(03--2)
Do you still live there?(03--2)
No. I sold the house and the furniture,(03--2)
put a few personal things in an old trunk,(03--2)
and shipped it to my children in New York.(03--2)
That's my destination.(03--2)
Are you married?(03--2)
My wife died four years ago.(03--2)
She was a wonderful woman. A real friend.(03--2)
I'm sorry. Really, I'm sorry.(03--2)
Lots of wonderful memories.(03--2)
We were married almost fifty years.(03--2)
Well, forty-seven, to be exact.(03--2)
John and I celebrate our fortieth anniversary next month.(03--2)
Oh, congratulations! That's nice.(03--2)
What does John do?(03--2)
He's an aerospace engineer(03--2)
and works for Orlando Aircraft Corporation.(03--2)
He started with them almost forty years ago.(03--2)
What do you do?(03--2)
I just retired. Had my own company.(03--2)
A construction company. Roads, bridges, big stuff.(03--2)
But I just sold it and retired.(03--2)
Excuse me, ma'am. Ticket, please.(03--2)
Would you kindly hold these keys, please?(03--2)
I have a ticket, I know.(03--2)
I was in the smoking section.(03--2)
It's OK, lady. Take your time.(03--2)
I'm sure it's in your purse, Mrs. Tobin.(03--2)
Oh, here it is.(03--2)
And here are your keys.(03--2)
Thank you.(03--2)
Do you have family in New York?(03--2)
No, no. But I do have very close friends in New York City.(03--2)
We like to go to the theater together.(03--2)
You said you have family in New York.(03--2)
Yes, indeed.(03--2)
A son and his wife and their three children--(03--2)
my grandchildren.(03--2)
You must be excited.(03--2)
I can't wait, to see them!(03--2)
Are you going to live with them?(03--2)
Yes.(03--2)
Permanently?(03--2)
Well... they want me to,(03--2)
but it's too early to know for sure.(03--2)
I'm pretty independent.(03--2)
I tried to teach my kids the importance of independence,(03--2)
but I'm not sure I want to be alone.(03--2)
Some people don't mind being alone.I do.(03--2)
I understand. But tell me.(03--2)
Why did you stop working?(03--2)
I retired because... I wanted to be with my family.(03--2)
I didn't want to be alone anymore!(03--2)
Ladies and gentlemen,(03--3)
Amtrak is happy to announce our arrival in New York City.(03--3)
The train will be stopping in five minutes.(03--3)
Please check to be sure you have your belongings.(03--3)
And have a good stay in the Big Apple.(03--3)
Thank you.(03--3)
Well, here we are.(03--3)
It was so nice meeting you, Mr. Stewart.(03--3)
And nice meeting you, too, Mrs. Tobin.(03--3)
Please look us up.(03--3)
We're in the phone book.(03--3)
Dr. Philip Stewart, in Riverdale.(03--3)
Your son?(03--3)
That's right. And have a good time in New York.(03--3)
And don't be so independent.(03--3)
You're very lucky to have a caring family.(03--3)
When can we go fishing?(03--3)
Robbie, we'll go fishing soon,(03--3)
and we'll take your dad with us.(03--3)
I'm ready, Grandpa. You name the day.(03--3)
That's a great idea, Grandpa!(03--3)
Philip needs a day off.(03--3)
Let's give him our presents--now.(03--3)
Good idea.(03--3)
Presents--for me?(03--3)
From me and Marilyn.(03--3)
And this one's from me.(03--3)
I looked all over the house to find it.(03--3)
Richard, these are terrific pictures.(03--3)
This one really brings back memories.(03--3)
You remember that day, Robbie?(03--3)
I sure do. It was fun.(03--3)
Oh,(03--3)
I'm sorry Susan isn't here.(03--3)
I miss her very much.(03--3)
She feels bad, too, Grandpa.(03--3)
She called to say the plane was delayed.(03--3)
You know airports.(03--3)
I can't wait to see her.(03--3)
She looks just like Grandma at that age.(03--3)
I'd better unpack.(03--3)
I started traveling twenty-four hours ago.(03--3)
I'm not so young anymore.(03--3)
Don't you want something to eat?(03--3)
No, thanks.(03--3)
After a good night's sleep, I'll enjoy breakfast even more.(03--3)
Well, come on, Dad.(03--3)
Ellen and I'll take you to your room.(03--3)
I'm sure glad you're here, Grandpa.(03--3)
Good night, Grandpa.(03--3)
Pleasant dreams.(03--3)
Philip, do you have the key to the trunk?(03--3)
I have the key, but it doesn't work.(03--3)
I sent the wrong key.(03--3)
I have something for you. I made it myself.(03--3)
I think you'll enjoy it.(03--3)
I researched it for over a year.(03--3)
It's our family tree.(03--3)
Oh, Grandpa! How exciting!(03--3)
Fabulous!(03--3)
What? I didn't know that your grandfather was born in Germany.(03--3)
Lots of interesting information about our family.(03--3)
A gift from me.(03--3)
Thank you so much.(03--3)
Grandpa! Grandpa!(03--3)
Oh, Grandpa, I'm so happy to see you!(03--3)
Oh, you look so beautiful, Susan.My granddaughter.(03--3)
Like I always said, you look just like Grandma.(03--3)
I think you're going to be very happy here with us.(03--3)
I know you will.(03--3)
I don't feel alone anymore.(03--3)
I am exhausted.(04--1)
My new exercise class is so hard.(04--1)
Your new exercise class?(04--1)
Yeah. My new advanced exercise class.(04--1)
Why advanced?(04--1)
My instructor thought that(04--1)
the beginner's class was too easy for me.(04--1)
Too easy for you?(04--1)
Don't laugh. In the beginner's class,(04--1)
they give you a chance to rest between exercises.(04--1)
So?(04--1)
The advanced class is nonstop.(04--1)
I lift weights every morning for sixty minutes(04--1)
without stopping.(04--1)
No problem.(04--1)
Listen, Richard,(04--1)
doing aerobics for an hour is a lot different than lifting weights.(04--1)
Yeah. Quite a bit different.(04--1)
I think aerobics is easy.(04--1)
I could work out in your class with no problem.(04--1)
You think so?(04--1)
Oh, without a doubt.(04--1)
When's the next class?(04--1)
Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. Try it.(04--1)
Tomorrow morning after lifting weights,(04--1)
I'll try aerobics.(04--1)
It's a nap. Tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.(04--1)
Aren't you going to the aerobics class this morning?(04--1)
Of Course. Easy. No sweat.(04--1)
You are not going to be able to move(04--1)
after this and the aerobics class.(04--1)
Are you kidding me?(04--1)
It's going to be a piece of cake.(04--1)
You want to bet?(04--1)
Yeah. What's the bet?(04--1)
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning(04--1)
and not feel a thing!(04--1)
The bet is --(04--1)
I win, and you cook dinner for the entire family.(04--1)
Or you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.(04--1)
It's a bet.(04--1)
Ok. Call my instructor, Jack Davis, right now.(04--1)
His number is 555-8842.(04--1)
The advanced class starts at ten o'clock.(04--1)
Well, it's eight twenty now.(04--1)
It only takes eight minutes by bicycle to the aerobics class.(04--1)
Give him a call.(04--1)
Davis Aerobics Center for Good Health.(04--1)
Jack Davis, please.(04--1)
This is Jack Davis.(04--1)
Hello. This is Richard Stewart.(04--1)
My wife, Marilyn Stewart, is a member of your program.(04--1)
I'd like to come to(04--1)
the ten o'clock advanced class this morning.(04--1)
Oh, fine, fine. Be here a few minutes early.(04--1)
You need to complete some forms before the class.(04--1)
Thanks. I'm on my way over.(04--1)
Good-bye.(04--1)
Bye-bye.(04--1)
It's all set. I'm going.(04--1)
Bye.(04--1)
Bye.(04--1)
See you later.(04--1)
Good luck.(04--1)
Don't forget about the bet.(04--1)
Dinner for the entire family.(04--1)
And that includes Susan.(04--1)
Don't you forget.(04--1)
OK, Richard. That's terrific.(04--2)
Your pressure is 120 over 75, and that's fine.(04--2)
Now stand up, please.(04--2)
Good, it's 122 over 80.(04--2)
You can sit down now.(04--2)
When was your last complete physical?(04--2)
Six months ago.(04--2)
Good. Do you have any back or knee problems?(04--2)
Nope. I am in perfect health.(04--2)
What do you do for a living, Mr. Stewart?(04--2)
I'm a photographer.(04--2)
Interesting. What do you photograph?(04--2)
Everything. The American scene. People, places, events.(04--2)
Did you ever think of photographing an aerobics class?(04--2)
No...I can't remember taking pictures of people exercising.(04--2)
But don't you think it'd be a good subject?(04--2)
Sure.(04--2)
I need some good photos for my advertising, Mr. Stewart.(04--2)
Maybe you can photogragh a class,(04--2)
and I can give you and Mrs. Stewart(04--2)
a month of classes free.(04--2)
When can I photograph a class?(04--2)
Anytime.(04--2)
How about today?(04--2)
Terrific!(04--2)
Hi.(04--2)
Oh, hi.(04--2)
Are we ready to go?(04--2)
Yeah. Yeah. Let's get in our lines.(04--2)
We're going to take it slow first.(04--2)
Stretch up...and we're going to go left first ...(04--2)
2,3,4 ... now switch. ...(04--2)
OK, hold to the right.(04--2)
Sunrises. Stretch it out. Flat back.(04--2)
Bring it up...and twists...and side...2 3...(04--2)
and left...push...push...turn...hit the floor.(04--2)
Take it side again....OK, and switch. Stretch it out.(04--2)
And we're going to warm down with a tango.(04--2)
Left, right. Enjoy it.(04--2)
Richard,(04--2)
did you go to the Davis Aerobics class today? (04--2)
Yes, I went to the aerobics class today.(04--2)
What is wrong with you?(04--2)
Nothing. I am in excellent health.(04--2)
I have ideal blood pressure. A perfect heart.(04--2)
In other words, I'm in wonderful condition.(04--2)
Richard, did you go to the aerobics class, really?(04--2)
And don't forget to invite Susan for dinner.(04--2)
And your legs don't hurt?(04--2)
Hurt? What do you mean?(04--2)
What about your arms? Lift your arms up like this.(04--2)
And they don't hurt not even a little?(04--2)
Nope.(04--2)
You are in great condition. I can't believe it!(04--2)
Grandpa, Ellen, Philip, Robbie, you and me.(04--3)
That's six steaks.(04--3)
Don't forget Susan.(04--3)
Seven steaks.(04--3)
Cooking dinner for the entire family is not so easy.(04--3)
The shopping: the salad:(04--3)
tomatoes,lettuce,cucumbers,and onions.(04--3)
The main course: steak and potatoes.(04--3)
Richard, how much broccoli do I need for seven people?(04--3)
Marilyn, I have to tell you something.(04--3)
At today's exercise class...(04--3)
Yes, Richard.(04--3)
Well, I didn't really exercise.(04--3)
I knew it!(04--3)
I wanted to, but Jack Davis needed a photographer.(04--3)
I'm sorry, Marilyn.(04--3)
I don't understand. Did you exercise or not?(04--3)
No. Instead of exercising, I photographed the class.(04--3)
And you didn't exercise?(04--3)
No.(04--3)
There's another advanced class today at four o'clock.(04--3)
We'll go together.(04--3)
What about the bet?(04--3)
Oh, the bet is still on,(04--3)
but you shop for the groceries.(04--3)
Remember, you win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.(04--3)
You win, and I cook dinner for the entire family.(04--3)
Including Susan.(04--3)
Four o'clock at the advanced exercise class. With me.(04--3)
Don't forget to breathe.(04--3)
Skip, hop, front.(04--3)
Twist..again...OK,now...scissors.(04--3)
This is fun. It's a piece of cake.(04--3)
Yeah. Just wait.(04--3)
5,6,7,go right,1,2,back,(04--3)
2,3,1,2,3,pony,pony...(04--3)
1,2,3,kick...1,2,3,kick...pony.(04--3)
And twist,(04--3)
OK. Let's pick up the pace.(04--3)
twist.(04--3)
How are you doing, Richard?(04--3)
I can barely move.(04--3)
2,3,4,front.Now we're going to run it off.(04--3)
Front...knees up,knees up.(04--3)
OK. Finish off by jogging in place.(04--3)
OK. Keep those knees up.(04--3)
All right. That's it for today.(04--3)
Thank you, everyone. See you next week.(04--3)
Thank you, Jack, but no thank you.(04--3)
The advanced exercise class is not so easy, huh?(04--3)
No, no, you were right. I was wrong.(04--3)
Come on, Richard. Get up. Let's go.(04--3)
You have to cook dinner for the entire family.(04--3)
Marilyn, I'm exhausted. I can't move.(04--3)
Oh, you'll do it. It's a piece of cake.(04--3)
Excuse me, Richard, Marilyn.(04--3)
You are a terrific instructor, Jack.(04--3)
Thanks. But I have a question.(04--3)
Is this your very first advanced aerobics class?(04--3)
Yes, it is.(04--3)
You are in great shape, Richard.(04--3)
Very few people last in this class(04--3)
for the full hour the very first time.(04--3)
It's true. You are in great shape.(04--3)
Thanks!(04--3)
I think we'll cook dinner together.(04--3)
We'll cook dinner together.(04--3)
Hi, Grandpa.(05--1)
Hi, Robbie.(05--1)
Can I help?(05--1)
Yes, indeed.(05--1)
Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator,(05--1)
and I'll make you two fried eggs.(05--1)
How about some bacon?(05--1)
Well, I've made enough for an army.(05--1)
You going to the baseball game today?(05--1)
It's a perfect day for it--a little cloudy but nice and warm.(05--1)
Dad and I were planning to go to the game,(05--1)
but he has to work today,(05--1)
and my friends don't want to go.(05--1)
It's not an important game, anyway.(05--1)
Do you have any other plans for the day?(05--1)
I'll work on my computer.(05--1)
I have a new math program, and I want to learn how to use it.(05--1)
Maybe you can teach me(05--1)
how to work on a computer someday.(05--1)
Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything,(05--1)
you need to work at it, Grandpa.(05--1)
This bacon is great.(05--1)
I love crispy bacon.(05--1)
Oh, what are you doing tomorrow?(05--1)
Nothing much.(05--1)
Well, maybe your dad and I could take you fishing with us.(05--1)
I'd like that, but ...(05--1)
But what?(05--1)
But Dad is always so busy.(05--1)
Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow?(05--1)
Sure, I can.(05--1)
Robbie says you can't take him to the game today.(05--1)
I really feel bad about it,(05--1)
but they need me at the hospital today,(05--1)
in the children's ward.(05--1)
I understand.(05--1)
Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.(05--1)
Definitely.(05--1)
We should.(05--1)
You and Robbie and me.(05--1)
Remember our first fishing trip?(05--1)
I sure do....(05--1)
Well, I've got to run, Dad.(05--1)
See you later.(05--1)
Going fishing?(05--1)
I'm thinking about it...(05--1)
So, how's work?(05--1)
Oh, the usual problems.(05--1)
You're working pretty hard these days.(05--1)
I guess I am.(05--1)
When did you last go fishing with Robbie?(05--1)
I remember exactly.(05--1)
It was on his birthday, June second, two years ago.(05--1)
We didn't catch anything.(05--1)
Remember our fishing trips?(05--1)
Yes. I loved them.(05--1)
Remember catching your first fish?(05--1)
How can I forget?(05--1)
I fell out of the boat!(05--1)
We had some good times together.(05--1)
Yes, we did.(05--1)
Maybe we should do it again.(05--1)
How about tomorrow?(05--1)
Don't you have to work?(05--1)
My paper work will wait.(05--1)
Oh, Robbie will be thrilled.(05--1)
I am, too, Son.(05--1)
I want to spend more time with Robbie.(05--1)
Tomorrow.(05--1)
It'll be like old times for you and me.(05--1)
And Robbie will love it.(05--1)
Well, what's the weather going to be like?(05--1)
Radio says sunny and mild.(05--1)
Well, I'll tell Robbie.(05--1)
And thanks, Dad.(05--1)
Don't thank me.(05--1)
I'm just being a grandfather.(05--1)
This is really neat!(05--2)
When do we eat?(05--2)
First, we have to catch some fish.(05--2)
In order to catch fish, you have to do this.(05--2)
Here we go.(05--2)
That's it.(05--2)
Then drop it into the water.(05--2)
All of this comes before eating. OK?(05--2)
How do you know so much about fishing?(05--2)
Grandpa taught me.(05--2)
We spent a lot of time fishing together.(05--2)
Now, the important thing is to get the hook close to the fish.(05--2)
All right?(05--2)
Like this.(05--2)
I think I see some fish right under us, Dad.(05--2)
Oh, not a chance!(05--2)
I just saw a big one!(05--2)
Hi, there!(05--2)
Hi.(05--2)
What's your name?(05--2)
Albert.(05--2)
Are you all alone?(05--2)
Yes, sir.(05--2)
How old are you, Albert?(05--2)
I'm ten.(05--2)
Where's your father?(05--2)
He's up there at the lodge.(05--2)
Does he know you're here?(05--2)
Yes, sir.(05--2)
OK, Robbie, maybe you should watch him.(05--2)
The water's pretty deep here.(05--2)
I'll watch him, Dad.(05--2)
What time is it?(05--2)
It's almost lunchtime, and no fish yet.(05--2)
I can go up to the lodge for some hot dogs and drinks.(05--2)
No way!(05--2)
We're here to catch our lunch.(05--2)
To catch fish, you need the right magic.(05--2)
That's right.(05--2)
I forgot!(05--2)
The right magic.(05--2)
Do it for Robbie, Dad.(05--2)
You remember?(05--2)
Sure. Come on.(05--2)
Well, first, you have to turn your hat around like this.(05--2)
Then you close your eyes and say the magic words.(05--2)
Fish, fish, send me a fish.(05--2)
Fish, fish, send me a fish....(05--2)
I got one!(05--2)
See, it works!(05--2)
It's a big one!(05--2)
Well, it always worked for me, too.(05--2)
Grandpa, get the net, please!(05--2)
Dad, you got one, too!(05--2)
You bet I have!(05--2)
Easy, Philip, easy.(05--2)
Sorry, Dad.(05--2)
Well, one more and I've got a pair of boots.(05--2)
You didn't say the magic words.(05--2)
Robbie's right.(05--2)
Yes, but you did, and we've got our lunch.(05--2)
Let's build a fire and cook it!(05--2)
Come on, Albert, you can help us!(05--2)
I want to stay here and fish.(05--2)
All right, but be careful.(05--2)
Is it finished yet?(05--2)
I think so.(05--2)
I hope you like your fish well done.(05--2)
Burned, you mean.(05--2)
Hey, I'm a doctor, not a chef.(05--2)
Help! Help! I can't swim!(05--2)
Dad! Grandpa! He fell in!(05--2)
Easy does it, Robbie.(05--2)
That a boy.(05--2)
That's it.(05--2)
He's not breathing, Philip!(05--2)
Robbie, run to the car!(05--2)
Bring a blanket and my medical bag.(05--2)
Yes, Dad.(05--2)
Now, come on, son. Come on, son.(05--2)
Breathe, Albert!(05--2)
Here's the bag.(05--3)
Will he be OK, Dad?(05--3)
I hope so.(05--3)
That's it.(05--3)
That's the way.(05--3)
That's it. There.(05--3)
Oh, it's going to be all right.(05--3)
That's it.(05--3)
Wrap him in the blanket, Dad!(05--3)
That's it. That's it.(05--3)
It's all right, Albert.(05--3)
You're going to be OK.(05--3)
I want my daddy!(05--3)
We'll take you to him.(05--3)
Easy now. Easy does it. That's it.(05--3)
Your dad is quite a guy.(05--3)
I know, Grandpa.(05--3)
How is he, Philip?(05--3)
He's asleep.(05--3)
He's going to be fine.(05--3)
How can I thank all of you?(05--3)
Thank my son Robbie.(05--3)
He pulled him out of the water.(05--3)
I'm very grateful, Robbie.(05--3)
Dad saved him, not me.(05--3)
I'm so thankful to all of you.(05--3)
So long.(05--3)
He's a lucky boy.(05--3)
Well, what do you say we get back to our fishing?(05--3)
That's a great idea.(05--3)
Uh-oh. It's probably the hospital.(05--3)
I have to get to a phone.(05--3)
It probably means we can't stay.(05--3)
That's OK.(05--3)
One of my patients has a high fever,(05--3)
and I have to go to the hospital.(05--3)
I'm sorry, Robbie.(05--3)
I guess I ruined your day.(05--3)
You didn't ruin my day, Dad.(05--3)
I understand. I really do.(05--3)
Why are you back so early?(05--3)
Philip had to go back to the hospital.(05--3)
He had an emergency.(05--3)
Oh, that's too bad, Robbie.(05--3)
Did it spoil your fun?(05--3)
No, Mom. We had a great time.(05--3)
Well, did you do any fishing?(05--3)
Yeah, we caught lots of them. Look!(05--3)
They had a special on frozen fish down at the supermarket.(05--3)
Oh, you really had a bad day.(05--3)
We had a good day.(05--3)
Robbie pulled a boy out of the water.(05--3)
And Dad saved his life.(05--3)
He's a terrific doctor, Mom.(05--3)
I know.(05--3)
-Hi, Pop.(05--3)
-Hi, Son.(05--3)
Hello, Dad.(05--3)
What a day!(05--3)
How about a cup of coffee, Son?(05--3)
I'd love a cup of coffee.(05--3)
How was the patient?(05--3)
She'll be fine.(05--3)
Was it serious?(05--3)
No.(05--3)
Until today, I was never really interested in medicine.(05--3)
Well, it's hard work.(05--3)
Now I know.(05--3)
I had a good time today, Robbie.(05--3)
Me, too.(05--3)
Why don't we do it again?(05--3)
Can we? When?(05--3)
How about next Saturday?(05--3)
Won't you be busy?(05--3)
I'm changing my schedule.(05--3)
Well, do we have a date?(05--3)
We sure do, Dad.(05--3)
Grandpa, can you come?(05--3)
I have other plans, Robbie.(05--3)
But I think you two can have a good time together without me.(05--3)
No, Dad, and certainly not without the right magic.(05--3)
OK,Philip.This is your third cup of coffee.(06--1)
We should get to work,(06--1)
or we won't be finished by dinnertime.(06--1)
I guess we must.(06--1)
We must.(06--1)
OK.The beginning of my famous Thanksgiving apple pie.(06--1)
One apple.Two apples.Three apples.Four apples.(06--1)
Come on, Philip!(06--1)
Get busy with your famous apple pie.(06--1)
There's much more to be done.(06--1)
Now, the ingredients.(06--1)
What goes into my apple pie besides apples?(06--1)
Ah,yes.Flour,sugar,butter.(06--1)
Butter, nice and cold and hard.(06--1)
OK, here are the walnuts.(06--1)
Last but not least,(06--1)
the reason my apple pie is famous--cinnamon.(06--1)
Cinnamon ...(06--1)
Ellen, where's the cinnamon?(06--1)
If there is any cinnamon,(06--1)
it's in the cabinet with the salt and pepper.(06--1)
Salt,pepper,dill weed,garlic powder,cinnamon.Ellen?(06--1)
Yes, Philip.(06--1)
Is it possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon?(06--1)
Yes, it is possible that we forgot to buy cinnamon.(06--1)
Well, how can I make my famous apple pie without cinnamon?(06--1)
Good morning.(06--1)
Oh, hi, Robbie. Good morning.(06--1)
Good morning. Robbie.(06--1)
Can you do me a favor?(06--1)
Sure, Dad. What?(06--1)
Remember my apple pie on Thanksgiving?(06--1)
What do you love about it?(06--1)
The apples?(06--1)
-No. The sssss...(06--1)
-cinnamon?(06--1)
Right. We don't have any cinnamon.(06--1)
I'll go down to Henry's grocery. He's always open.(06--1)
I'll get some for you.(06--1)
That's my boy!(06--1)
Oh, put your heavy jacket on, Robbie.(06--1)
It's cold outside.(06--1)
Alexandra might call.(06--1)
Tell her I'll call her right back.(06--1)
OK.(06--1)
Thanks, Son.(06--1)
Uh, why does he always have to slam the door?(06--1)
Hello...Hello,Alexandra.How are you?(06--1)
... Fine.(06--1)
Robbie just went to the store.(06--1)
He'll be back soon.(06--1)
He said he'll call you.(06--1)
...Oh,oh,I see...Oh...certainly.(06--1)
Well, do you have the phone number there?(06--1)
...Oh...I see...Please,I know he wants to talk to you.... (06--1)
Thank you,(06--1)
and happy Thanksgiving to you and your family, too.(06--1)
Try to come by later for dessert...Bye.(06--1)
That was Alexandra.(06--1)
She and the Molinas(06--1)
are going to spend Thanksgiving with their cousins.(06--1)
She doesn't have the phone number.(06--1)
Oh, Robbie will be disappointed.(06--1)
He'll be grouchy.(06--1)
Maybe she'll call back. She promised.(06--1)
Here's your cinnamon, Pop.(06--1)
It was a dollar and sixty cents.(06--1)
You forgot to ask me for the change.(06--1)
Or did you forget to give it to me?(06--1)
Thanks, Son.(06--1)
Alexandra called.(06--1)
I'll call her back.(06--1)
She said she'll call you later.(06--1)
She's not at home.(06--1)
You should have your breakfast, Son.(06--1)
Make you feel better.(06--1)
Protein, vitamins.(06--1)
She said she'll call back?(06--1)
Yes, she did.(06--1)
Good morning, everyone!(06--1)
Happy Turkey Day! (06--1)
What's wrong? (06--1)
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.(06--1)
What's gotten into him?(06--1)
He missed a phone call.(06--1)
From ...?(06--1)
Yes, Alexandra.(06--1)
It's nice to see young love....Oh,to be young again!(06--1)
Where's the coffee?(06--1)
I love parades.(06--2)
The Thanksgiving Day parade is always such great fun.(06--2)
Look at that Superman balloon!(06--2)
Wowee! Just floating along high above Central Park West.(06--2)
Don't you just love it?(06--2)
Oh, and the bands and the music.(06--2)
John Philip Sousa.(06--2)
I love his music.(06--2)
Oh, look at that float, Robbie.(06--2)
Look at those funny-looking clowns.(06--2)
It's for kids.(06--2)
Maybe so, but parades always make me feel like a kid.(06--2)
Remember when you and your dad and I(06--2)
went to the Thanksgiving Day parade?(06--2)
You were four or five years old,I think.(06--2)
Hello, hello....Oh,hi,Susan.(06--2)
How are you?... Here's Mom.(06--2)
Hello, Susan.(06--2)
Yes, he missed a phone call from Alexandra.(06--2)
Yes, I know, but he'll get over it.(06--2)
Good. Then you'll be here about five?(06--2)
Oh, fine.(06--2)
I look forward to seeing you and Harry and Michelle.(06--2)
Drive carefully.(06--2)
Good-bye.(06--2)
Taste Ellen's turkey dressing.(06--2)
It's delicious.(06--2)
I'm not surprised.(06--2)
It's Grandma's recipe.(06--2)
It's my favorite part of the meal.(06--2)
What about my famous apple pie?(06--2)
Dad, your apple pie is my favorite dessert.(06--2)
How's the parade?(06--2)
OK.(06--2)
Mom! Is it for me?(06--2)
No, Robbie.(06--2)
Who was it?(06--2)
Wrong number.(06--2)
Philip, would you join me in the kitchen, please?(06--2)
It's getting late.(06--2)
We have vegetables to prepare.(06--2)
Can I help with anything?(06--2)
No, honey.(06--2)
You just relax with Grandpa.(06--2)
I'll get you to help serve later.(06--2)
Ellen reminds me so much of Grandma.(06--2)
What time does the Michigan football game come on?(06--2)
Four.(06--2)
Philip!(06--2)
I'll be back to see the game.(06--2)
Grandpa, when did Dad graduate from Michigan?(06--2)
Let me think.(06--2)
He graduated from medical school in 1960(06--2)
and from the University of Michigan in 1956.(06--2)
Did you go to Michigan, too, Grandpa?(06--2)
Yup. I graduated in 1937.(06--2)
I've got to start thinking about college soon.(06--2)
OK, everybody.(06--3)
I want to welcome Harry and his daughter Michelle(06--3)
to Thanksgiving with us.(06--3)
Thank you, Dr. Stewart.(06--3)
Call me Philip.(06--3)
OK.(06--3)
But first, I think we should take a moment(06--3)
and remember the meaning of Thanksgiving.(06--3)
Philip, I took Michelle to a school play(06--3)
about the first Thanksgiving.(06--3)
Well, why don't you tell us about that, Michelle?(06--3)
Thanksgiving was about the Pilgrims,(06--3)
the first settlers in America.(06--3)
They shared the first harvest with the Indians(06--3)
and gave thanks.(06--3)
All right.(06--3)
Then in that spirit let each of us give thanks.(06--3)
Each in his own way.(06--3)
Who wants to begin?(06--3)
I will.(06--3)
I give thanks for being here with my family and for being well,(06--3)
so I can enjoy you all.(06--3)
All rihgt!(06--3)
We love you, Grandpa.(06--3)
I'd like to give thanks for a healthy year, a good job,(06--3)
and for meeting Harry and Michelle.(06--3)
We'd like to give thanks for meeting Susan(06--3)
and the Stewart family.(06--3)
I love you, Daddy.(06--3)
Thanks, Harry.(06--3)
That was very kind of you.(06--3)
I'd like to give thanks for Grandpa coming to live with us.(06--3)
And I'd also like to thank my math teacher(06--3)
for giving me a passing grade.(06--3)
And call me, Alexandra.(06--3)
Oh, Robbie!(06--3)
She'll call.(06--3)
You go first, Marilyn.(06--3)
I'm thinking.(06--3)
You go first.(06--3)
Well, you all know I'm working on my photo album.(06--3)
It's not finished yet.(06--3)
And I'd like to thank Marilyn for being so patient.(06--3)
Thanks, Richard.(06--3)
I should thank you for encouraging me(06--3)
to keep working on my fashion designs.(06--3)
I'm lucky to have a husband with an artistic eye.(06--3)
Oh, we have a lot to be thankful for.(06--3)
For the food on this table.(06--3)
Just like the Pilgrims.(06--3)
I'll go along with that, Ellen.(06--3)
Well, help me serve, Robbie.(06--3)
It was a wonderful meal, Mrs. Stewart.(06--3)
Thank you.(06--3)
And now to see the end of the football game.(06--3)
Exactly.(06--3)
Where are you going, Philip?(06--3)
Remember, the Michigan football game?(06--3)
And Michigan needs a touchdown.(06--3)
Did you forget something?(06--3)
Dad, your famous apple pie.(06--3)
Just let me see the score, Ellen.(06--3)
Go ahead, Philip.(06--3)
We should all take a little break before dessert.(06--3)
Oh, who could that be?(06--3)
Oh, it must be Alexandra.(06--3)
I invited her to come by for dessert.(06--3)
You did?(06--3)
I like Ellen.(06--3)
You know everyone, Alexandra.(06--3)
No, she doesn't know Harry Bennett and his daughter Michelle.(06--3)
Nice to meet you.(06--3)
Hi.(06--3)
Hi.(06--3)
Hello, Alexandra.(06--3)
Hi, Marilyn.(06--3)
Hi, Susan.(06--3)
Happy Thanksgiving.(06--3)
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.(06--3)
Please sit down, Alexandra.(06--3)
Dad, Richard--Alexandra's here.(06--3)
Michigan needs a touchdown.(06--3)
Three minutes to play.(06--3)
Hi, Alexandra. Welcome.(06--3)
Hello, Alexandra.(06--3)
Yes, Michigan needs a touchdown.(06--3)
One tiny little touchdown, with just three minutes to play.(06--3)
You want Michigan to win.(06--3)
How'd you guess?(06--3)
And Alexandra brought us a pumpkin pie.(06--3)
What happened?(06--3)
We forgot to turn the oven on.(06--3)
We did?(06--3)
Philip, why don't you go(06--3)
watch the last three minutes of the game.(06--3)
I will serve coffee and pumpkin pie.(06--3)
OK. I'll be back in a few minutes.(06--3)
Robbie, would you bring the dessert plates.(06--3)
And, Marilyn, would you pour coffee, please.(06--3)
Sure, Ellen.(06--3)
How was your Thanksgiving dinner, Alexandra?(06--3)
Just wonderful, Mr. Stewart.(06--3)
The Molinas are a large family.(06--3)
I love being with them.(06--3)
I'm glad you came by, Alexandra.(06--3)
I am, too.(06--3)
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!(06--3)
Great Thanksgiving.(06--3)
Lots to be thankful for.(06--3)
Michigan scored a touchdown.(06--3)
Alexandra came by.(06--3)
And nobody misses Philip's famous apple pie.(06--3)
Oh, Grandpa!(06--3)
Robbie, this new Walkman is absolutely wonderful.(07--1)
Richard and Marilyn bought it for me for my birthday. (07--1)
They're so thoughtful.(07--1)
You are very lucky, Robbie, to have such a nice family.(07--1)
Is something wrong, Alexandra?(07--1)
No, nothing.(07--1)
Yes, there is.(07--1)
I can tell.(07--1)
What's the matter?(07--1)
Come on, you can tell me.(07--1)
What's up?(07--1)
I don't know.(07--1)
Something's wrong.(07--1)
OK, let's talk.(07--1)
I received a letter from my parents this morning.(07--1)
Did they write some bad news?(07--1)
No.(07--1)
Well, then why are you so sad?(07--1)
I miss them.(07--1)
I miss them very much.(07--1)
I'm sorry, Alexandra.(07--1)
But I understand.(07--1)
The Molinas treat me so nicely,(07--1)
and I love being with your family so much ...(07--1)
but when I received the letter(07--1)
with photographs of my family, I cried.(07--1)
I cried because I miss them all.(07--1)
You really miss your family, don't you?(07--1)
Yes. I know I must seem silly.(07--1)
It's not like I have nobody.(07--1)
I like the Molinas very much,(07--1)
and they're so kind to me.(07--1)
Hey, why don't we go out(07--1)
for a cheeseburger and french fries?(07--1)
That'll cheer you up.(07--1)
And you can use my Walkman.(07--1)
That's a good idea.(07--1)
But if we go out,(07--1)
please don't complain(07--1)
about your math teacher or your math homework.(07--1)
I want to have fun.(07--1)
So do I.(07--1)
I have to turn off the lights,(07--1)
or else my father will get really angry.(07--1)
He says I never turn them out when I leave.(07--1)
If they come home and they're on ...(07--1)
Do you hear something?(07--1)
Yes.(07--1)
What was that?(07--1)
It sounded like a dog barking.(07--1)
It sounded like a dog barking right here.(07--1)
Yeah.(07--1)
A dog!(07--1)
A springer spaniel!(07--1)
Come on in!(07--1)
Make yourself at home.(07--1)
Oh, you poor little thing.(07--1)
Come here.(07--1)
Come on.(07--1)
Poor baby.(07--1)
Where did you come from?(07--1)
Her name's Gemma,(07--1)
and she belongs to Mr. and Mrs. Levinson.(07--1)
There's a phone number --(07--1)
five five five...eight four four eight.(07--1)
Robbie, maybe you should call them(07--1)
and tell the Levinsons we have their cute little spaniel. (07--1)
I've always wanted a springer spaniel.(07--1)
She's so cute.(07--1)
The number you are calling--555-8448(07--1)
is no longer in service.(07--1)
The number's no longer in service.(07--1)
Oh, you poor, poor baby.(07--1)
You've lost your family.(07--1)
We'll find them.(07--1)
Don't worry, Alexandra.(07--1)
Don't worry, Alexandra.(07--2)
We'll find the owner.(07--2)
How, Robbie?(07--2)
Let me think.(07--2)
Gemma, sit.(07--2)
Good Gemma.(07--2)
Give me your paw.(07--2)
Good Gemma.(07--2)
This dog is well trained.(07--2)
She likes you, too.(07--2)
So how are we going to find the owners?(07--2)
With a little help from the ASPCA,(07--2)
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.(07--2)
They're the ones.(07--2)
We once found a cat.(07--2)
She was caught in the branches of our tree.(07--2)
And Dad called the ASPCA.(07--2)
They came and solved the problem.(07--2)
Robbie, let's call them.(07--2)
Let me see -- ASPCA....(07--2)
Here it is.(07--2)
ASPCA Animal Shelter.(07--2)
555-7700.(07--2)
Hello, ASPCA.(07--2)
Hello, my name is Robbie Stewart.(07--2)
I have a lost dog I'd like to bring to you.(07--2)
How late are you open?(07--2)
We're open till nine P.M.(07--2)
Thank you.(07--2)
I'll bring the dog over by nine.(07--2)
Thanks.Bye.(07--2)
Thanks.(07--2)
Good-bye.(07--2)
They're still open?(07--2)
They're open until nine o'clock.(07--2)
We have two and a half hours.(07--2)
Let's take Gemma by there now.(07--2)
They'll find the owner.(07--2)
I hope so.(07--2)
I'm so sad to see this little dog without her family.(07--2)
I'm sure they'll find the owner.(07--2)
But if they don't, I'll adopt her.(07--2)
She's so cute.(07--2)
Look at those eyes.(07--2)
She's hard to resist.(07--2)
Don't you just love her?(07--2)
I'd like to keep her, too.(07--2)
But I'll be going home to Greece(07--2)
at the end of the semester.(07--2)
She just wants love and affection.(07--2)
Come on, Robbie.(07--2)
Let's get her to the animal shelter,(07--2)
so they can find her owners quickly.(07--2)
Don't worry, Gemma.(07--2)
We'll get you home.(07--2)
It's not easy being away from home.(07--2)
Come on, poochie.(07--2)
Atta girl!(07--2)
Let's go.(07--2)
We're off to the animal shelter.(07--2)
Your name?(07--2)
Robbie Stewart.(07--2)
And this is Alexandra Pappas.(07--2)
Your name will do, Mr. Stewart.(07--2)
Your address?(07--2)
46 Linden street, Riverdale.(07--2)
Where did you find the dog?(07--2)
She found us.(07--2)
You tried calling the number on the collar?(07--2)
Yes, but the number's no longer in service.(07--2)
And there's no address on the dog tag?(07--2)
There's no other information.(07--2)
No ID number.(07--2)
Without that, it's hard.(07--2)
You will try to find the dog's owner.(07--2)
Oh, we'll try, believe me.(07--2)
And if you don't?(07--2)
Yes?(07--2)
If you don't...can I...can I adopt the dog?(07--2)
Why, yes.(07--2)
If the owners don't claim the dog in forty-eight hours,(07--2)
then you can apply for adoption.(07--2)
How do I do that?(07--2)
You really want to?(07--2)
Yes, I'm serious.(07--2)
If no one comes to claim Gemma,(07--2)
I'd like to adopt her.(07--2)
It's not difficult.(07--2)
OK.(07--3)
If you want to adopt an animal,(07--3)
first we need to know some references.(07--3)
References?(07--3)
People we know?(07--3)
Friends, teachers....(07--3)
We need to talk to some people about you.(07--3)
We want to be sure that you're responsible(07--3)
and that you can take good care of an animal.(07--3)
Then you have to fill out this form(07--3)
about your family background.(07--3)
Is that it?(07--3)
No, there's more.(07--3)
We need to know about your history with animals.(07--3)
Have you ever owned an animal?(07--3)
Yes.(07--3)
We had a cat when I was eight years old.(07--3)
I love cats.(07--3)
Do you have any animals now?(07--3)
Unfortunately, no.(07--3)
Anything else?(07--3)
We also like to know(07--3)
your reasons for wanting an animal.(07--3)
Just to hold it and cuddle with it.(07--3)
Just to have as a pet.(07--3)
I love animals.(07--3)
To have a friend -- a pal.(07--3)
You know, man's best friend is his dog.(07--3)
And one thing more.(07--3)
If you're under twenty-one years of age...(07--3)
That's me.(07--3)
Then an adult must sign for you.(07--3)
Uh-oh.(07--3)
No problem.(07--3)
My parents will think it's a good idea.(07--3)
I'll be back with them.(07--3)
If the real owners don't come to claim Gemma...(07--3)
After forty-eight hours.(07--3)
But please call first.(07--3)
Thanks for your information and for being so helpful.(07--3)
It's my pleasure.(07--3)
Nice talking to both of you.(07--3)
Thanks again.(07--3)
Bye.(07--3)
Maybe the real owners will come to claim her.(07--3)
Her eyes look so sad.(07--3)
She must really miss them.(07--3)
I see you're both animal lovers.(07--3)
We are.(07--3)
Good-bye, Miss Aborn.(07--3)
We'll call in a couple of days.(07--3)
Good-bye, and thanks for bringing Gemma in.(07--3)
Bye.(07--3)
I keep thinking about the dog--about Gemma,(07--3)
alone in the animal shelter.(07--3)
I know.(07--3)
But I promise you, Alexandra,(07--3)
the dog is just fine.(07--3)
They're very kind to the animals.(07--3)
I know they are.(07--3)
I mean about her being alone.(07--3)
Even if they are kind to Gemma,(07--3)
she's still alone, without her family.(07--3)
Ready, folks?(07--3)
Are you ready, Alexandra?(07--3)
Yes, I'm ready.(07--3)
I'll have the chef's salad, please.(07--3)
I will have a cheeseburger, medium rare,(07--3)
with raw onion, and french fries, please.(07--3)
Anything to drink?(07--3)
A diet cola, please.(07--3)
Ginger ale with lots of ice for me, thank you.(07--3)
I've got it.(07--3)
Thanks.(07--3)
Aren't you surprised(07--3)
that the animal shelter is so careful(07--3)
about finding homes for the animals?(07--3)
No, I'm not.(07--3)
And a cheeseburger, medium rare,(07--3)
with onion and french fries.(07--3)
And a ginger ale with lots of ice.(07--3)
Salad dressing?(07--3)
Hey, I wanted you to hear my new sound system(07--3)
when the dog scratched on the front door.(07--3)
Let's finish eating,and then we'll go back to my house.(07--3)
I want you to hear my new tapes.(07--3)
I've got some great new dance music.(07--3)
Hello.(07--3)
Stewart residence.(07--3)
Hello.(07--3)
Is Robbie Stewart there?(07--3)
This is he.(07--3)
Who's this?(07--3)
This is Linda Aborn from the animal shelter.(07--3)
It's Linda from the animal shelter.(07--3)
Yes, Linda.(07--3)
Hi.(07--3)
We have good news and bad news, Robbie.(07--3)
Oh?(07--3)
The good news is that the Levinsons have come by(07--3)
to pick up the dog.(07--3)
The bad news is, you won't be able to adopt the dog.(07--3)
That's OK.(07--3)
Come by one day and look at some of the other dogs.(07--3)
I'm sure there's one for you.(07--3)
Thanks, Robbie.(07--3)
And the Levinsons thank you for bringing their dog to us.(07--3)
Thanks, Linda.(07--3)
Bye.(07--3)
The owners claimed Gemma?(07--3)
That's right.(07--3)
I'm glad for the dog.(07--3)
I guess I am, too.(07--3)
She said if I come by,(07--3)
she'll help me find another dog.(07--3)
Come on.(07--3)
Let's dance.(07--3)
Molly, I need your special talent for handling special matters.(08--1)
Like what special matters?(08--1)
Well, I have a scheduling problem.(08--1)
Yes?(08--1)
I have three tonsillectomies set for Friday with Dr. Earl.(08--1)
Yes?(08--1)
I need to fit a fourth operation into his schedule.(08--1)
And ... I know you can do it.(08--1)
Who's the patient?(08--1)
Carl Herrera.(08--1)
The boy has infected tonsils,(08--1)
and we should remove them as soon as possible.(08--1)
Well, I'll try to arrange the schedule, Dr. Stewart.(08--1)
But it's not going to be easy.(08--1)
I know you'll be able to take care of it.(08--1)
Well, Mrs. Herrera,(08--1)
Carl will be perfectly fine after we remove his tonsils.(08--1)
Thank you for your reassurance, Dr. Stewart.(08--1)
He's had so many colds and sore throats recently.(08--1)
Well, it's a very easy operation, Carl.(08--1)
You won't feel a thing.(08--1)
But when do they do it?(08--1)
This Friday.(08--1)
But Saturday's my birthday.(08--1)
Well, we could reschedule the operation, Mrs. Herrera,(08--1)
but I don't want to put it off too long.(08--1)
No, I think it's important to do it now.(08--1)
We can have a birthday party for you, Carl,(08--1)
When you come out of the hospital.(08--1)
But it won't be on my birthday.(08--1)
But your health is more important, Carl. Believe me.(08--1)
I don't want my tonsils out.(08--1)
Nurse Baker, would you come in, please?(08--1)
Hello, Mrs. Herrera. Hi, Carl, How're you doing?(08--1)
I don't want my tonsils out.(08--1)
Come with me, Carl.(08--1)
You and I will talk this over.(08--1)
She has a special way with kids.(08--1)
She sure does.(08--1)
Carl, does your throat hurt?(08--1)
Yes.(08--1)
OK. Do you want to get better?(08--1)
Yes.(08--1)
OK. We want you to get better, too.(08--1)
You'll have your tonsils out tomorrow,(08--1)
and you won't get so many colds anymore.(08--1)
But if I have my tonsils out tomorrow,(08--1)
I'll miss my birthday party on Saturday.(08--1)
I know.(08--1)
It's a problem, isn't it?(08--1)
Let me try to work something out.(08--1)
What?(08--1)
I have to think about it.(08--1)
You're fooling me.(08--1)
Oh, I'm not, Carl.(08--1)
Give me a chance to think about it,(08--1)
and I'll come up with something.(08--1)
A surprise? (08--1)
Maybe.(08--1)
But you just put on your pajamas and robe,(08--1)
and I'll think of a surprise.(08--1)
Will it hurt?(08--1)
No.(08--1)
There are other boys and girls here,(08--1)
and they're having their tonsils out.(08--1)
You'll meet them.(08--1)
I don't want to.(08--1)
Change your clothes, Carl.(08--1)
Everything will be just fine.(08--1)
OK.(08--2)
Do you know how to play charades?(08--2)
Frank, you've never played charades?(08--2)
Nope.(08--2)
Carl, you're sure you've never played?(08--2)
OK, Betty, Tim, and Frank.(08--2)
We're going to play charades.(08--2)
Frank, you can learn as we go.(08--2)
And, Carl, you join in at any time.(08--2)
OK, let me think.(08--2)
OK, I've got one.(08--2)
All right.(08--2)
A movie!(08--2)
A movie!(08--2)
Right.(08--2)
A movie.(08--2)
OK.(08--2)
Six words.(08--2)
It has six words.(08--2)
That's easy.(08--2)
I can play.(08--2)
Good. OK.(08--2)
We've got a movie.The title...(08--2)
Six words.(08--2)
Right.(08--2)
First word ...(08--2)
Sounds like.(08--2)
Sounds like ...(08--2)
You got that part right.(08--2)
Yes.(08--2)
Sounds like ...(08--2)
Sounds like what?(08--2)
Sounds like no.(08--2)
Absolutely right, Frank.(08--2)
Sounds like no.(08--2)
OK.(08--2)
We've got a movie.(08--2)
Six words.(08--2)
The first word sounds like no.(08--2)
Row. Row.(08--2)
Go.(08--2)
Nope.(08--2)
Show.(08--2)
That's it--show.(08--2)
No ... OK ...(08--2)
Snow.(08--2)
Absolutely right, Betty.(08--2)
Sounds like no -- snow.(08--2)
OK, a movie. Six words.(08--2)
The first word is snow.(08--2)
This is fun.(08--2)
Oh, OK.(08--2)
The fifth word.(08--2)
Right, fifth word.(08--2)
Seven?(08--2)
Absolutely right.(08--2)
Very good.The fifth word is seven.(08--2)
OK, we've got a movie.(08--2)
The first word is snow.(08--2)
Fifth word, seven.(08--2)
I got it!(08--2)
I got it!(08--2)
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.(08--2)
I got it.(08--2)
I got it.(08--2)
Frank, you got it.(08--2)
Betty, you had it, but you didn't say it.(08--2)
I knew it.(08--2)
Carl, now you know charades.(08--2)
Why don't you join us?(08--2)
I don't like charades.(08--2)
It's for babies.(08--2)
Oh, I like it.(08--2)
Well, they're babies.(08--2)
You're a sore loser.(08--2)
Yeah.(08--2)
No arguing.(08--2)
Save your voices.(08--2)
Between now and tomorrow(08--2)
you're all going to have your tonsils out.(08--2)
And you won't be able to speak for a while.(08--2)
So save your voices till then.(08--2)
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.(08--2)
Well, what's going on?(08--2)
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.(08--2)
This is a rough group.(08--2)
I didn't want to play charades,(08--2)
so they're angry at me.(08--2)
Why don't you want to play?(08--2)
Because I don't want to be here.(08--2)
I don't want my tonsils out.(08--2)
Why not?(08--2)
Because my birthday is tomorrow.(08--2)
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.(08--2)
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.(08--2)
But my birthday is tomorrow.(08--2)
I'm sorry, Carl.(08--2)
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home,(08--2)
But it won't be on my birthday!(08--2)
And you promised me a surprise.(08--2)
It hurts, doesn't it?(08--3)
You'll feel better tomorrow, Betty, believe me.(08--3)
Only one day, and it won't hurt as much.(08--3)
Do you feel like eating?(08--3)
Having some dinner?(08--3)
Oh, don't look so sad.(08--3)
Let me tell you about your dinner.(08--3)
It's ice cream.(08--3)
Ice cream.(08--3)
All kinds of flavors.(08--3)
Chocolate.(08--3)
Strawberry?(08--3)
Vanilla?(08--3)
Vanilla, too?(08--3)
I see you're feeling better already, Betty.(08--3)
So you will have dinner?(08--3)
OK, honey, we'll see to it(08--3)
that you have strawberry and vanilla ice cream.(08--3)
Just rest now.(08--3)
You need some rest to help you get better quickly.(08--3)
Hi, Frank.(08--3)
How you doing?(08--3)
Oh, come on now.(08--3)
You're a big boy.(08--3)
It doesn't hurt that much, does it?(08--3)
Oh, I'm sorry it hurts so much,(08--3)
and you won't be able to have dinner.(08--3)
You're just going to have to have ice cream.(08--3)
Yes, ice cream.(08--3)
Lots of flavors.(08--3)
Want to hear them?(08--3)
Chocolate?(08--3)
Then chocolate it is.(08--3)
One scoop or two?(08--3)
Three scoops?(08--3)
Then three it will be.(08--3)
You want three scoops also?(08--3)
Chocolate, too?(08--3)
Well, I see you're feeling better.(08--3)
Well, at least you're acting like you feel better.(08--3)
Three scoops of chocolate ice cream for Tim coming up.(08--3)
Hi, Carl.(08--3)
How're you doing?(08--3)
I know it hurts.(08--3)
But it'll be better tomorrow.(08--3)
In the meantime, what would you like?(08--3)
Surprise.(08--3)
A surprise?(08--3)
I promised you a surprise, didn't I?(08--3)
And it wasn't just ice cream, was it?(08--3)
Your birthday is tomorrow, isn't it?(08--3)
Well, maybe, just maybe,(08--3)
there will be a surprise.(08--3)
But first you have to smile.(08--3)
I just want to see one smile from you.(08--3)
No smile, no surprise.(08--3)
That's the deal.(08--3)
No smile, no surprise.(08--3)
If you want a surprise,(08--3)
then you've got to smile first.(08--3)
How're you all doing?(08--3)
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better(08--3)
because we have a little surprise for you today.(08--3)
It's Carl's birthday,(08--3)
and we have Popo the Clown to entertain you.(08--3)
And here he is--Popo the Clown.(08--3)
-Happy birthday, Carl. (08--3)
-Happy birthday. (08--3)
All right, everybody.(08--3)
OK, Carl.(08--3)
It's your birthday.(08--3)
What 's your wish?(08--3)
What would you like?(08--3)
Hmm?(08--3)
You want to play charades?(08--3)
Who is it?(09--1)
Dad.(09--1)
Come on in, Dad.(09--1)
I thought you might be hungry.(09--1)
I brought you a chicken sandwich and a glass of milk.(09--1)
I am hungry.(09--1)
Thanks, Dad.(09--1)
What time is it, anyway?(09--1)
Ten o'clock.(09--1)
What are you working on?(09--1)
I'm writing a story for the high-school paper.(09--1)
Can't you finish it tomorrow?(09--1)
No, I have to turn it in in the morning.(09--1)
What's it about?(09--1)
I'm writing an article on the feelings about graduation.(09--1)
And ... how do you feel?(09--1)
Me?(09--1)
A little scared.(09--1)
And excited, too.(09--1)
I felt the same way.(09--1)
The scary part's leaving home and moving to college.(09--1)
Oh, leaving home is part of growing up.(09--1)
Well, don't work all night.(09--1)
I don't mind.(09--1)
I enjoy writing.(09--1)
Well,(09--1)
maybe you should think about becoming a writer.(09--1)
Maybe I should.(09--1)
You have lots of time to decide.(09--1)
That's the worst part--making decisions.(09--1)
You'll be OK.(09--1)
Good night, Son.(09--1)
Good night, Dad.(09--1)
"Hail to the victors valiant,(09--1)
Hail to the conquering heroes,(09--1)
Hail, Hail to Michigan,(09--1)
The champions of the West!"(09--1)
Ah, good morning, Robbie.(09--1)
Good morning, Dad.(09--1)
How's my grandson?(09--1)
Fine, Grandpa. Fine!(09--1)
What's all the cheering about?(09--1)
Did the University of Michigan win another football game?(09--1)
Better than that.(09--1)
Tell him, Philip.(09--1)
I just spoke with Charley Rafer.(09--1)
Who's Charley Rafer?(09--1)
He's the Dean of Admissions for the University of Michigan.(09--1)
And it turns out he's a classmate of Philip's.(09--1)
We were both on the tennis team.(09--1)
Great!(09--1)
It is great.(09--1)
He's going to be in New York tomorrow(09--1)
to interview applicants for admission.(09--1)
And he's agreed to fit you into his schedule.(09--1)
But I may not want to go to Michigan.(09--1)
It's one of the best schools in the country, Robbie.(09--1)
I studied medicine there.(09--1)
Your grandfather went to the Engineering School there.(09--1)
I know that, but ...(09--1)
You said you wanted to be a doctor like your father.(09--1)
Not exactly.(09--1)
You couldn't pick a finer medical school than Michigan.(09--1)
Yes, I know that.(09--1)
Let's meet with Charley at the university club.(09--1)
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.(09--1)
It doesn't mean you're going to Michigan.(09--1)
It doesn't mean you have to be a doctor.(09--1)
But the interview will be good experience for you.(09--1)
In that case, it's OK.(09--1)
Dad, growing up means(09--1)
making my own decisions, doesn't it?(09--1)
You're right, Robbie.(09--1)
But, like your Grandpa suggested,(09--1)
have the interview.(09--1)
And then make your own decision.(09--1)
That sounds fine.(09--1)
I know it's sudden, Robbie,(09--1)
but this is an important opportunity.(09--1)
We'll head down there first thing tomorrow morning.(09--1)
OK?(09--1)
Sure, Dad.(09--1)
I want you to know something, Son.(09--1)
I'm ... very proud of you.(09--1)
Thanks, Dad.(09--1)
Well, I've got an appointment at the hospital.(09--1)
I'll see you all at dinnertime.(09--1)
Bye, Dad.(09--1)
Is something still wrong, Robbie?(09--1)
I'll be OK.(09--1)
Going away to college for the first time(09--1)
always makes one a little nervous.(09--1)
I guess so.(09--1)
I'll be OK. I just need time to think.(09--1)
Sorry, Robbie.(09--2)
Sorry to be late this morning,but,(09--2)
well, we've still got some time for a cup of coffee(09--2)
I can't wait to see my old pal Charley Rafer.(09--2)
Neither can I.(09--2)
So you thought about it, huh?(09--2)
Yes, I have, Dad.(09--2)
Well, I'm glad.(09--2)
I knew you'd realize(09--2)
that this interview could be an important experience for you.(09--2)
I came to that conclusion.(09--2)
That's very wise, Robbie.(09--2)
Very wise.(09--2)
Now let's head off for the city and the university club.(09--2)
Thanks, Dad.(09--2)
Thanks ... for what?(09--2)
Thanks for hearing me out. And ...(09--2)
And ...?(09--2)
And thanks for being such an understanding father.(09--2)
Well, thank you, Robbie. Thank you.(09--2)
Philip Stewart!(09--2)
It's great to see you!(09--2)
Charley Rafer--you look as young as ever.(09--2)
You must be Robbie.(09--2)
Hi.(09--2)
Yes, this is my youngest son Robbie.(09--2)
Robbie, I want you to meet(09--2)
one of the best tennis players on the Michigan team-(09--2)
Charley Rafer.(09--2)
Nice to meet you, Dean Rafer.(09--2)
Well, are you as good a tennis player as your dad?(09--2)
No, I'm not very good at it.(09--2)
Frankly, neither was I.(09--2)
Charley was the star of the team.(09--2)
Yeah. Thanks.(09--2)
Well, how're you been, Philip?(09--2)
Oh, working too hard.(09--2)
Doesn't show.(09--2)
How's Ellen?(09--2)
Fine, thank you.(09--2)
And how's Marge?(09--2)
She's still giving the toughest English history exams(09--2)
in the school and loving every minute of it.(09--2)
And speaking of minutes,(09--2)
I have interviews until noon,(09--2)
so why don't we get right to work?(09--2)
Can you have lunch with us later?(09--2)
I'd love to, Philip, but I'm afraid I can't.(09--2)
I'm only here two days,(09--2)
and I have interviews with twenty-six applicants.(09--2)
I understand.(09--2)
Well, thanks.(09--2)
I'll wait outside.(09--2)
Good luck, Son.(09--2)
Did you bring your transcript from high school?(09--2)
Yes, sir.(09--2)
Right here.(09--2)
Thank you.(09--2)
Please sit down.(09--2)
I see under "activities" that(09--2)
you've been writing for the school paper.(09--2)
Yes, sir.(09--2)
What kinds of articles have you written?(09--2)
All kinds--sports, editorials, theater reviews.(09--2)
You name it, I've written it.(09--2)
Hmmm.(09--2)
Well,have you ever thought of becoming a journalist?(09--2)
A professional writer?(09--2)
Not until recently.(09--2)
Michigan has a fine School of Journalism.(09--2)
Yes, I know that.(09--2)
You seem to have some reservations.(09--2)
I'm a little uncertain.(09--2)
It's been very nice talking to you.(09--2)
Nice talking to you, sir.(09--2)
One piece of advice.(09--2)
The most important thing is for you to decide your own future.(09--2)
Yes, sir.(09--2)
Good-bye, Dean Rafer.(09--2)
Good-bye, Robbie.(09--2)
Good luck.(09--2)
I had an interview today, too.(09--3)
I had a great interview(09--3)
with Admissions at Columbia University.(09--3)
Really?(09--3)
What did they say?(09--3)
Will you get into the school?(09--3)
Well, they didn't say anything for sure.(09--3)
But I figure that with my grades and with my personality,(09--3)
I'll have no problem.(09--3)
Columbia's a terrific school.(09--3)
What are you going to do?(09--3)
Do? I don't know.(09--3)
I also applied to NYU.(09--3)
You sound excited about Columbia.(09--3)
What's your problem, Mike?(09--3)
Indecision. Indecision.(09--3)
It's not easy,(09--3)
and this is an important decision we have to make.(09--3)
What about you?(09--3)
How was your interview with Michigan?(09--3)
The interview was fine.(09--3)
It's a great college.(09--3)
It is.(09--3)
My father would like me to go there.(09--3)
He and my Grandpa both went there.(09--3)
Great medical school, too.(09--3)
I know.(09--3)
You can follow in your father's footsteps.(09--3)
Ah!I'd like to follow in my own footsteps,Mike. (09--3)
What do you want to study?(09--3)
I've been thinking.(09--3)
I think I want to study journalism(09--3)
to be a reporter--a newspaperman.(09--3)
You do a pretty good job on the Riverdale High School paper.(09--3)
And I've been thinking about it a lot lately.(09--3)
Have you discussed it with your parents?(09--3)
No. But I have to.(09--3)
OK. Let's talk.(09--3)
Hi, Son. Is everything all right?(09--3)
Hi, Dad. Everything's fine.(09--3)
I was just waiting for you to get home(09--3)
so we could talk.(09--3)
Anything special you want to talk about?(09--3)
There is, Dad.(09--3)
I'm listening.(09--3)
Well, I know you and Mom have given up a lot(09--3)
to save money for my college tuition.(09--3)
We want you to go to college, Robbie.(09--3)
I know. I do.(09--3)
But?(09--3)
Well, I've thought a lot about which college,(09--3)
and one of them is Columbia.(09--3)
Columbia? Why Columbia?(09--3)
First, they have an excellent School of Journalism.(09--3)
They do.(09--3)
And your friends are planning to go to Columbia?(09--3)
That's only part of it.(09--3)
It's complicated.(09--3)
I'll try to explain.(09--3)
Mike and I had a hamburger this afternoon, and we talked.(09--3)
Yes?(09--3)
Well, we talked about a lot of things.(09--3)
He applied to Columbia,(09--3)
and his interview was very successful.(09--3)
He thinks he'll be accepted,(09--3)
and he really wants to go there.(09--3)
Dean Rafer called me today.(09--3)
He told me he was very impressed with you.(09--3)
He's a nice man.(09--3)
He was very kind.(09--3)
He told me(09--3)
you had some doubts about wanting to go to Michigan.(09--3)
Yes. I do.(09--3)
I'm just not sure about what I want to do.(09--3)
That's OK.(09--3)
You understand?(09--3)
Let me tell you something, Robbie.(09--3)
Something that might be surprising to you.(09--3)
What? Tell me.(09--3)
Well, Grandpa wanted me to study engineering, like him.(09--3)
Well, I wasn't clear about my future,(09--3)
but I knew engineering was not for me.(09--3)
What did you tell Grandpa?(09--3)
The truth.(09--3)
Then you're not upset(09--3)
about my not wanting to go into medicine?(09--3)
I'm not upset at all.(09--3)
I'm just happy that we're able to talk about it.(09--3)
I am too, Dad.(09--3)
I suppose you want to apply to Columbia.(09--3)
Yes,but I also want to apply to several other colleges.(09--3)
I thought you wanted to go to Columbia.(09--3)
Well, I might want to go to Columbia.(09--3)
But I might not.(09--3)
I just want to be able to make my own decision.(09--3)
You're a real Stewart!(09--3)
And if I think about it long enough, you never know(09--3)
Never know what?(09--3)
If I make my own decision,(09--3)
I might choose Michigan.(09--3)
Robbie, you're something!(09--3)
You know, when I was your age,(09--3)
I said exactly the same thing to Grandpa.(09--3)
Good morning, Susan.(10--1)
Good morning, Sam.(10--1)
What's the schedule today?(10--1)
Ten o'clock,(10--1)

OK.(10--1)
Telephone Mrs. Zaskey at the advertising agency.(10--1)
I did that. Go on.(10--1)
Eleven o'clock,approve the sketches for the toy spaceship.(10--1)
Where are they?(10--1)
Right here.(10--1)
Did you look at them?(10--1)
Yes, I did.(10--1)
What do you think of the spaceship?(10--1)
I think the kids'll love it.(10--1)
Would you show me the drawings, please?(10--1)
Huh.(10--1)
Now, what else is on the schedule today?(10--1)
Well, at one o'clock(10--1)
you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Levine,(10--1)
the client from the Toytown Stores.(10--1)

At Rossano's.(10--1)
Hmm. Anything else?(10--1)
At four o'clock,(10--1)
you have a meeting with the production staff(10--1)
in the conference room.(10--1)
Make sure everybody is at that meeting.(10--1)
Will do.(10--1)
At six you're meeting, Mr. Ozawa.(10--1)
Oh, yes. Are his models here?(10--1)
They're in my office.(10--1)
I'd like to see them.(10--1)
Right.(10--1)
What else?(10--1)
Come on, Sam ...(10--1)
You work too hard, Susan.(10--1)
When was your last day off?(10--1)
Hmm. I can't remember.(10--1)
You really ought to take some time off.(10--1)
What for?(10--1)
To enjoy the simple things in life ...(10--1)
I know, Sam.(10--1)
Maybe soon.(10--1)
To smell the flowers.(10--1)
Oh, wait a minute. What's today's date?(10--1)
Today is the twelfth. Why?(10--1)
It seems to me I scheduled something else.(10--1)
There's nothing else in the appointment book.(10--1)
I'm sure I did.(10--1)
Oh, well, I'll probably remember it later.(10--1)
I hope it isn't important.(10--1)
Hmm. It's probably nothing.(10--1)
OK, let's get started.(10--1)
Would you call Priscilla Smith at FAO Schwarz,please?(10--1)
Right.(10--1)
These are the models from the Japanese film maker.(10--1)
Thank you. Just put them on my desk.(10--1)
And the new drawings for the toy spaceship.(10--1)
Wonderful.(10--1)
That was fast.(10--1)
We have a new artist.(10--1)
She's very talented.(10--1)
What time is it, anyway?(10--1)
My watch stopped.(10--1)
It's eleven thirty.(10--1)
What time is my lunch date with Bill Levine?(10--1)
One o'clock.(10--1)
Remind me to leave at twelve forty-five.(10--1)
Did you remember your other appointment for today?(10--1)
No,(10--1)
but I have a feeling(10--1)
it's going to be too late when I do remember.(10--1)
Yes, Sam?(10--1)
I just solved the mystery.(10--1)
What did I forget?(10--1)
You have some guests in the reception room.(10--1)
What? Who?(10--1)
Mr. Harry Bennett and his daughter.(10--1)
I remember!(10--1)
Oh ... Harry!(10--1)
I made a lunch date with him and his daughter weeks ago.(10--1)
Is he a client?(10--1)
He's a friend.(10--1)
Well, he's here with his daughter to have lunch.(10--1)
I met her at Thanksgiving,(10--1)
and I promised to have lunch with both of them today.(10--1)
Yes, indeed.(10--1)
What are you going to do about your appointment?(10--1)
with Mr. Levine?(10--1)
Any suggestions?(10--1)
Oh!(10--1)
Hi, Michelle.(10--2)
Hello, Harry.(10--2)
It's nice to see you again.(10--2)
Hello.(10--2)
Hi, Susan.(10--2)
We have both been excited about seeing you(10--2)
and having lunch with you today.(10--2)
Michelle picked these flowers out for you.(10--2)
Daddy, can we go soon?(10--2)
We're going to go to lunch in a few minutes, honey.(10--2)
But I'm thirsty.(10--2)
OK.You go out and get a drink of water at the fountain.(10--2)
The fountain is over there, Michelle.(10--2)
Near the Exit sign.(10--2)
Thank you.(10--2)
Michelle is a little shy.(10--2)
I used to be that way when I was her age.(10--2)
Harry, if Michelle doesn't want to go,(10--2)
we don't have to.(10--2)
She'll be fine.(10--2)
Remember,(10--2)
I haven't dated any one else since her mother died.(10--2)
This is a little difficult for her.(10--2)
Are you ready to go?(10--2)
Yes. But could you wait one minute?(10--2)
I have a call to make.(10--2)
Would you excuse me?(10--2)
Sam, get Mr. Levine at Toytown Stores(10--2)
on the telephone for me, please.(10--2)
Right.(10--2)
Hello. Susan Stewart calling Mr. Levine, please.(10--2)
He's on the phone. (10--2)
Mr. Levine, Susan Stewart.(10--2)
I find myself in an embarrassing situation.(10--2)
I made another lunch date for today(10--2)
and forgot to enter it in my appointment book.(10--2)
Can you and I meet for drinks tomorrow?(10--2)
I'd really appreciate it...Yes...Thank you...(10--2)
Tomorrow at five o'clock at the Biltmore.(10--2)
I'll see you then.(10--2)
Thank you, Mr. Levine.(10--2)
Welcome to the South Street restaurant, folks.(10--2)
What'll it be?(10--2)
What do you recommend?(10--2)
Well, the crab salad's always a big hit.(10--2)
Susan, would you like the crab salad?(10--2)
I'd love the crab salad.(10--2)
Michelle, would you like to try the crab salad,too?(10--2)
OK, Daddy.(10--2)
We'll have three crab salads(10--2)
and a pitcher of lemonade.(10--2)
Help yourself to celery and carrots and other vegetables.(10--2)
We used to catch crabs.(10--2)
Where was that?(10--2)
We had a summer house on Fire Island.(10--2)
Do you remember, Michelle?(10--2)
Sure.(10--2)
You and Mommy used to take me on the ferryboat.(10--2)
Sometimes, at night,(10--2)
we would go down to the beach and catch crabs,(10--2)
remember?(10--2)
With a piece of meat on a string!(10--2)
Right.(10--2)
Well,I think I'm going to go get us all some vegetables.(10--2)
There you go.(10--2)
Thank you.(10--2)
And some ice-cold lemonade.(10--2)
-Thank you.(10--2)
-Enjoy it.(10--2)
Michelle, can I help you with the lemonade?(10--2)
No, thank you.(10--2)
I'll wait for my father.(10--2)
Michelle, can we have a talk?(10--2)
Sure.(10--2)
I know you miss your mother.(10--2)
You do?(10--2)
Yes. And I'm not trying to take her place.(10--2)
Then why are you and Daddy(10--2)
spending so much time together?(10--2)
Because we like each other.(10--2)
And right now, he needs a friend.(10--2)
I'm his friend.(10--2)
I know you are.(10--2)
Sometimes he's very sad.(10--2)
And so are you, I think.(10--2)
Sometimes.(10--2)
I'd like to be your friend, too.(10--2)
Will you let me be your friend, Michelle?(10--2)
So, what were you two talking about?(10--2)
Just girl talk, Daddy.(10--2)
It's too hard to explain.(10--2)
You're probably right.(10--2)
Well, let's get started.(10--2)
Oh, it's a quarter to four,(10--3)
and I have a production meeting at four.(10--3)
I planned to take you for a ride in Central Park(10--3)
in a horse and carriage.(10--3)
Harry, I'd love to,(10--3)
but I have work to do.(10--3)
OK. We'll walk back to your office with you.(10--3)
It's so nice out.(10--3)
I decided to forget about my accounting problems(10--3)
and just enjoy this beautiful spring day.(10--3)
Take the time, Susan.(10--3)
I know I should,(10--3)
but ... well, there are too many things to do.(10--3)
I understand.(10--3)
I'll go for a ride with Michelle.(10--3)
Right.(10--3)
Well, I had a really nice time.(10--3)
So did I.(10--3)
So did I.(10--3)
I'm sorry you can't come with us, Susan.(10--3)
So am I.(10--3)
Bye-bye.(10--3)
Harry! Michelle!(10--3)
Can you wait till I make a phone call?(10--3)
Sure.(10--3)
Susan Stewart's office.(10--3)
Sam, this is Susan.(10--3)
Hi. How was lunch?(10--3)
Fine.(10--3)
You're late.(10--3)
The production department's waiting in the conference room.(10--3)
I know.(10--3)
Ask Paul Smith to fill in for me.(10--3)
He knows everything about the production schedule,(10--3)
and he can answer any questions.(10--3)
Right.(10--3)
Don't tell any one,(10--3)
but I'm taking a little time to smell the flowers.(10--3)
Good for you.(10--3)
It'll be our secret.(10--3)
But schedule another production meeting for tomorrow.(10--3)
I'll be back(10--3)
for my six o'clock appointment with Mr. Ozawa.(10--3)
OK, Susan.(10--3)
And have a nice afternoon.(10--3)
Thanks.(10--3)
She likes you.(10--3)
I know. I like her.(10--3)
How'd you do it?(10--3)
We had a talk.(10--3)
About what?(10--3)
Life.(10--3)
And what did you decide?(10--3)
That's a secret...between us women.(10--3)
Ellen, I'd like your opinion.(11--1)
About what?(11--1)
Well, Richard and I feel that with a baby coming(11--1)
we need to have our own place to live.(11--1)
Oh.(11--1)
Well, what do you think about Richard and me(11--1)
looking for a small house or an apartment(11--1)
at this point in our lives?(11--1)
We love having you here,(11--1)
and there is room,(11--1)
and ... and when the baby comes,(11--1)
the baby can stay in your room for a while.(11--1)
Richard feels we need to find a small house.(11--1)
I remember when I was pregnant with Richard.(11--1)
Philip and I were living with Grandma and Grandpa.(11--1)
Philip was a young doctor,(11--1)
and he kept talking about having a house of our own.(11--1)
It's natural.(11--1)
What did you do?(11--1)
We looked at a lot of houses.(11--1)
Did you find one?(11--1)
Oh, not at first.(11--1)
We couldn't afford it.(11--1)
Grandpa wanted to lend us the money to buy one,(11--1)
but Philip is too independent.(11--1)
He didn't want to borrow any money.(11--1)
Sounds like Richard.(11--1)
They're all alike.(11--1)
Richard is a real Stewart.(11--1)
He's independent,(11--1)
and sometimes just stubborn.(11--1)
When did you buy a house?(11--1)
After Richard was born.(11--1)
I was teaching music,(11--1)
and Philip was opening his first medical office.(11--1)
Where was the house?(11--1)
Right here in Riverdale.(11--1)
Of course, it was a small house,(11--1)
but just right for us.(11--1)
It's funny. History repeats itself.(11--1)
Now Richard and I are having a baby,(11--1)
and we probably won't be able to(11--1)
afford a house right away, either.(11--1)
Why don't you look at some houses, Marilyn?(11--1)
Good idea.(11--1)
Look in the real-estate section of Sunday's Times.(11--1)
You'll learn a lot.(11--1)
Maybe we should(11--1)
speak to a real-estate agent about a house.(11--1)
And a bank about a mortgage.(11--1)
I'll talk to Richard about it.(11--1)
I think it's a good idea, Ellen.(11--1)
We can learn a lot by asking.(11--1)
And if I can be of any help,(11--1)
let me know.(11--1)
As a matter of fact,(11--1)
my friend Virginia Martinelli is a real-estate agent.(11--1)
Good.(11--1)
You won't believe this,(11--1)
but she sold us our first house and this one.(11--1)
Well, I'll tell Richard,(11--1)
and we'll go to see her.(11--1)
Do you think the skirt length is right, Ellen?(11--1)
Do you think it's too long?(11--1)
I think the skirt is just right.(11--1)
Are you planning to attach a train to it?(11--1)
No. No train. Just the dress.(11--1)
But I am going to make a headpiece of lace.(11--1)
That dress is gorgeous.(11--1)
Thanks, Ellen.(11--1)
And thanks for the advice about the house.(11--1)
I'll talk to Richard about it(11--1)
the minute he comes home.(11--1)
And remember,(11--1)
we love having you here.(11--1)
There's no need to rush.(11--1)
I remember your parents' first house very well.(11--2)
It was on Spring Avenue, near the park.(11--2)
I grew up in that house.(11--2)
Yes, and you were such a cute baby.(11--2)
I've seen pictures of him.(11--2)
He had blond hair.(11--2)
I've been friendly with the Stewart family for a long time,(11--2)
so it's my pleasure(11--2)
to help you find a house now.(11--2)
Well, we're not sure we can afford one.(11--2)
But we'd like to find out(11--2)
about the possibilities.(11--2)
That's a good idea.(11--2)
I love your house on Linden Street.(11--2)
I sold your father that house seventeen years ago.(11--2)
Really?(11--2)
Yes, Mom was pregnant with Robbie then,(11--2)
and they needed the extra room.(11--2)
I hear you're expecting a baby, Mrs. Stewart.(11--2)
Mmm-hmm.So we will be needing more room.(11--2)
Oh, so you don't need something immediately?(11--2)
No.But in five or six months...(11--2)
And time passes so quickly.(11--2)
Yes, it does.(11--2)
Well, when you called,(11--2)
you gave me enough information(11--2)
about your salaries and your savings.(11--2)
So I have a good idea about your financial situation.(11--2)
Let me show you some pictures of houses.(11--2)
With two bedrooms?(11--2)
Yes, I think I can show you some.(11--2)
Of course, they won't be in Riverdale.(11--2)
The cost of housing's too high for you here.(11--2)
I haven't thought about living anywhere else.(11--2)
We've always lived in this area.(11--2)
Where should we look for a house, Mrs. Martinelli?(11--2)
Well, we have an office in Mount Kisco.(11--2)
It's a lovely area,(11--2)
and it's only about an hour's drive from here.(11--2)
Here.(11--2)
I have a book with photos of some homes in that area.(11--2)
Now, let's see..(11--2)
Here(11--2)
This is a lovely two-bedroom house in your price range.(11--2)
It's pretty,(11--2)
but I prefer a two-story home.(11--2)
I do, too.(11--2)
I don't care for a ranch type.(11--2)
OK.(11--2)
Oh, this is a wonderful house.(11--2)
I know it well.(11--2)
I sold it to the present owners.(11--2)
It looks wonderful.(11--2)
This is a two-bedroom, two-bath house.(11--2)
It has a full basement,(11--2)
and it is on a half-acre lot.(11--2)
You can probably afford this one.(11--2)
I like this house.(11--2)
So do I.(11--2)
And the price is right.(11--2)
Would you like to go see it?(11--2)
Yes. We're planning(11--2)
to talk to someone at the bank next week.(11--2)
Perhaps we could see the house this weekend.(11--2)
If someone doesn't buy it before then,(11--2)
But let's keep looking.(11--2)
Just to get an idea of some other possibilities.(11--2)
This is very helpful, Mrs. Martinelli.(11--2)
Here.(11--2)
This is a wonderful example of Spanish-style architecture.(11--2)
I love the roof tiles on a Spanish-style house.(11--2)
It looks like the houses in Hollywood.(11--2)
It's interesting.(11--2)
A house like this in Riverdale costs double the price.(11--2)
Oh my!(11--2)
Here's a real buy.(11--2)
It's a bargain.(11--2)
This house just came on the market.(11--2)
It's quite lovely.(11--2)
Is it a two-bedroom house?(11--2)
No. It has three bedrooms and three baths.(11--2)
I know the house.(11--2)
It has a brand new kitchen.(11--2)
And a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling.(11--2)
And there's a two-car garage.(11--2)
Then why don't we go look at this house, too?(11--2)
It's a good investment.(11--2)
Thank you, Mrs. Martinelli.(11--2)
Thanks so much.(11--2)
My pleasure.(11--2)
Give my best to your parents.(11--2)
Your father's a wonderful doctor, Richard.(11--2)
He took care of my daughter(11--2)
when she was a child.(11--2)
He's the best pediatrician in Westchester.(11--2)
Thanks, Mrs. Martinelli.(11--2)
I'll give them your regards.(11--2)
We really appreciate your advice.(11--2)
I do think you should go see the houses(11--2)
and talk to the bank.(11--2)
Here.(11--2)
Let me give you some information sheets about the houses.(11--2)
They're both very good buys.(11--2)
Well, thanks so much for your help and your time,(11--2)
Mrs. Martinelli.(11--2)
We've got a lot to talk about.(11--2)
Mmm-hmm. Thanks.(11--2)
How do you do?(11--3)
Hello.(11--3)
I'm Ralph Riley.(11--3)
I'm Richard Stewart, and this is my wife, Marilyn.(11--3)
Pleased to meet you.(11--3)
Likewise, Mr. Riley.(11--3)
Please, sit down. What can I do for you?(11--3)
We'd like to discuss a mortgage.(11--3)
For a house.(11--3)
Fine. Are you buying a house(11--3)
or are you refinancing your present home?(11--3)
We're planning to buy a house.(11--3)
And we'd like to find out about a mortgage.(11--3)
We are customers of the bank.(11--3)
As a matter of fact, my whole family banks here.(11--3)
I have some questions to ask.(11--3)
Do you own your house or do you rent?(11--3)
Neither.(11--3)
We live with my parents, Dr. and Mrs. Philip Stewart.(11--3)
And how old are you?(11--3)
I'm twenty-nine.(11--3)
I'm thirty.(11--3)
And, Mr. Stewart, what is your occupation?(11--3)
I'm a freelance photographer.(11--3)
And, Mrs. Stewart, are you working?(11--3)
Yes. I'm a designer, and I work in a boutique.(11--3)
Did you bring any savings or salary information?(11--3)
Last year's tax forms?(11--3)
Yes. Here they are.(11--3)
OK. What...what kind of house did you have in mind?(11--3)
We're talking about buying(11--3)
a two-bedroom house in Mount Kisco.(11--3)
Here are the financial details on the house.(11--3)
Thank you.(11--3)
Are you prepared to make a ten-percent down payment?(11--3)
Yes, we are.(11--3)
Payments over thirty years?(11--3)
Yes.(11--3)
Do you think we can get a loan?(11--3)
Well, it depends. Do you own any other property?(11--3)
Any stocks or bonds?(11--3)
No.(11--3)
I see. Then you don't have any collateral.(11--3)
Perhaps you could get a guarantor--(11--3)
someone to sign for the loan for you.(11--3)
Why is that necessary?(11--3)
Since you don't have enough income,(11--3)
and you don't already own any property,(11--3)
the bank needs to be sure(11--3)
you can pay the mortgage every month.(11--3)
A guarantor is responsible for the loan(11--3)
if you can't make the payments.(11--3)
I see. Well, the idea of buying a house is exciting.(11--3)
Thank you, Mr. Riley. We'll read this over carefully.(11--3)
Thank you.(11--3)
Good-bye. Thanks.(11--3)
Good-bye. And hope to see you soon.(11--3)
I hope so, too.(11--3)
Take care.(11--3)
Good-bye.(11--3)
It all sounded so easy(11--3)
until they mentioned needing collateral or a guarantor.(11--3)
We have no collateral.(11--3)
And I don't think it's a good idea(11--3)
to ask Dad to sign as a guarantor.(11--3)
I don't feel right about it.(11--3)
I understand your feelings about it, Richard.(11--3)
Now, tell me, what's the problem?(11--3)
We can get a loan from the bank(11--3)
if we can put up some collateral.(11--3)
And we don't own anything to use as collateral.(11--3)
Or someone can sign with us as a guarantor.(11--3)
Why don't you speak to Dad?(11--3)
No.If we buy a house,I want to be able to handle it alone.(11--3)
Everybody needs help sometimes, Richard.(11--3)
I understand Richard's feelings about it, Ellen.(11--3)
In two or three months, I'll have an advance on my book(11--3)
and be able to put more money down.(11--3)
What about the house in Mount Kisco?(11--3)
Somebody else'll buy it by then.(11--3)
Then there'll be other houses, Marilyn.(11--3)
Richard has a point. You're just beginning to look.(11--3)
We're in no great rush. It's true.(11--3)
This has been a great learning experience for us,Marilyn.(11--3)
Talking to the real-estate agent.(11--3)
Looking at the houses.(11--3)
Talking to the loan officer at the bank.(11--3)
It has been a learning experience. That's true.(11--3)
I think you're doing the right thing. Taking your time.(11--3)
Looking around. Especially with a purchase of this kind.(11--3)
You're talking about a lot of money.(11--3)
We'll call Mrs. Martinelli and tell her to keep looking for us.(11--3)
And I'll call Mr. Riley at the bank(11--3)
and tell him we'll see him in a couple of months.(11--3)
And if you ever need Dad or me to help you...(11--3)
We know.(11--3)
You know we'll be there for you.(11--3)
It's a Stewart tradition. We're a family.(11--3)
Is that you,Susan?(12--1)
It's me, Grandpa.(12--1)
Am I glad to see you!(12--1)
And am I glad to see you!(12--1)
I am also glad to be here.(12--1)
How are things?(12--1)
I have been talking to a group of salesmen(12--1)
since ten this morning,(12--1)
and I'm real exhausted.(12--1)
Well, you look good.(12--1)
What's Harry doing tonight?(12--1)
He and Michelle(12--1)
are visiting relatives in New Jersey today.(12--1)
The rest of our family went to the movies.(12--1)
So it's just you and me, Susan.(12--1)
It's nice to be alone with you, Grandpa.(12--1)
We don't get to see enough of each other.(12--1)
Oh, I feel the same way, Susan.(12--1)
I miss seeing you.(12--1)
But to tell the truth,(12--1)
next time(12--1)
I'd like to go into the city and meet you there,(12--1)
instead of you coming here.(12--1)
You don't need to do that, Grandpa.(12--1)
Yeah, I do.(12--1)
I need to get out more.(12--1)
Well, I mean(12--1)
there's a lot to do around the house,(12--1)
and I love being here with the family,(12--1)
you know,(12--1)
but I'm restless.(12--1)
Since I retired,(12--1)
I've got extra time on my hands.(12--1)
I understand, Grandpa.(12--1)
I think you do.(12--1)
Frankly,(12--1)
I'd like to use my brain a little more.(12--1)
Grandpa,(12--1)
you have so much energy and so many years of experience.(12--1)
There are probably a lot of places for you to work(12--1)
Particularly in the construction field.(12--1)
But at my age,(12--1)
I'm not looking for a full-time job.(12--1)
I'm retired.(12--1)
But I'm bored.(12--1)
Well, there must be something.(12--1)
Maybe I can help.(12--1)
Let's go into the kitchen,(12--1)
and maybe you can help me set the table.(12--1)
Sounds good to me.(12--1)
What are we having?(12--1)
I prepared lamb chops,(12--1)
mashed potatoes,and a tossed green salad to begin with.(12--1)
Grandpa, you are a terrific guy!(12--1)
You're still thinking about something to do,aren't you?(12--1)
A job of some kind.(12--1)
That's right.(12--1)
I've been thinking about it for weeks now.(12--1)
There must be some way to put my mind to good use.(12--1)
We'll find a solution.(12--1)
A positive solution(12--1)
to your finding a way to use that wonderful mind of yours.(12--1)
Sam, would you come in, please?(12--2)
You sound like something's bothering you, Susan.(12--2)
The sketches for the cover of the new doll book?(12--2)
That's not it.(12--2)
Please sit down.(12--2)
Sure.(12--2)
I need your advice on a personsal matter,(12--2)
but it's not about me.(12--2)
You need my advice on a personal matter,(12--2)
and it's not about you.(12--2)
It's about my grandfather.(12--2)
What's the problem?(12--2)
It won't sound like a big deal,(12--2)
but it is.(12--2)
I had dinner with him Saturday,(12--2)
and he's very unhappy about not working.(12--2)
I thought he was retired(12--2)
and pleased to be living with the family.(12--2)
He is,(12--2)
but there's so much energy and talent in the man,(12--2)
and he doesn't get to use it.(12--2)
But what can I do?(12--2)
What kind of advice are you looking for?(12--2)
Simply this.(12--2)
John Marchetta runs this company.(12--2)
He founded this company.(12--2)
Right.(12--2)
John Marchetta gave me my start here six years ago,(12--2)
When I first graduated from college.(12--2)
He gave me the chance to use my talents(12--2)
and made me feel more confident.(12--2)
Right.(12--2)
Maybe he can do the same thing for your grandfather.(12--2)
Or at least give him some advice.(12--2)
Right.(12--2)
Then I've solved your problem.(12--2)
I can always depend on you, Sam.(12--2)
I'm glad to help.(12--2)
Shall I call Mr. Marchetta for you?(12--2)
No, no. I'll do that.(12--2)
Thanks.(12--2)
Now, how's the Stewart family?(12--2)
Fine, thank you, Mr. Mrarchetta.(12--2)
Except for my grandfather.(12--2)
What's wrong, Susan?(12--2)
What's wrong with him?(12--2)
He needs to work.(12--2)
In fact, that is the reason why I'm here to see you.(12--2)
I know you're building a new factory,(12--2)
and I thought...maybe...(12--2)
my grandfather is(12--2)
so experienced in the construction trade,(12--2)
he could be so valuable.(12--2)
Tell him to come and see me(12--2)
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.(12--2)
I have an idea that may solve the problem for him(12--2)
and help a lot of other people.(12--2)
Really, Mr. Marchetta?(12--2)
Can I tell him that?(12--2)
Sure can.(12--2)
Ten o'clock in the morning. Here.(12--2)
Oh, thank you!(12--2)
Hi. I'm Malcolm Stewart.(12--3)
John Marchetta.(12--3)
Sit down, sit down.(12--3)
Susan has told me a great deal about you.(12--3)
She says you're quite a man.(12--3)
She says(12--3)
a lot of wonderful things about you too, Mr. Stewart.(12--3)
That's always nice to hear, Mr. Marchetta.(12--3)
Call me John.(12--3)
May I call you Malcolm?(12--3)
Let's talk business.(12--3)
That's music to my ears.(12--3)
I understand(12--3)
you used to be in the construction business.(12--3)
Yup. Forty-three years.(12--3)
Here's a brief description(12--3)
of forty-three years of on-the-job training.(12--3)
That is some history!(12--3)
You're a valuable asset, Malcolm.(12--3)
Very valuable.(12--3)
Thank you.(12--3)
Yup. Forty-three years.(12--3)
Half that time in my own construction company.(12--3)
Big jobs--factories, shopping malls.(12--3)
That kind of thing.(12--3)
Then you retired.(12--3)
Yes.(12--3)
After my wife died,(12--3)
and I felt I should spend more time(12--3)
with my children and grandchildren.(12--3)
I lived in Florida,(12--3)
and they lived in New York.(12--3)
I understand.(12--3)
My dautghter Cami lives in New York.(12--3)
I like being near her.(12--3)
When I came here,(12--3)
I planned to take a few months off.(12--3)
Relax with the family and then look for some work.(12--3)
Put my experience on the line(12--3)
but, unfortunately,(12--3)
there isn't any work for a retired person my age.(12--3)
Sometimes there is,(12--3)
and sometimes there isn't.(12--3)
Well, I'm involved with an organization,(12--3)
and we're trying to resolve that problem.(12--3)
What's that?(12--3)
TOPS.(12--3)
T-O-P-S--means Talented Older People's Society.(12--3)
I'd like to be a member.(12--3)
How much are the dues?(12--3)
There are no dues.(12--3)
The organization serves major companies in this city.(12--3)
Why?(12--3)
Because our members are men and women like you.(12--3)
Experienced, talented, retired.(12--3)
But our members want to go out there(12--3)
and use their talents.(12--3)
They want to work.(12--3)
That is fantastic, John!(12--3)
I've got an idea for you, Malcolm.(12--3)
Just fill out this form for me.(12--3)
It'll only take a few minutes.(12--3)
Sit right here,(12--3)
and do it while I talk to my secretary.(12--3)
When I get back, we'll talk about my new factory.(12--3)
My company is a member of TOPS.(12--3)
So I try hard to find opportunities for people like you.(12--3)
Malcolm.(12--3)
And when I see an opportunity,(12--3)
I can act on it.(12--3)
Well, I can use your brainpower on the job right now.(12--3)
Have you got time this morning(12--3)
to go over to the construction site with me?(12--3)
I'd like to have you meet my foreman--(12--3)
get some background on the job.(12--3)
I've got plenty of time.(12--3)
I'll be right back.(12--3)
We'll go over to the job site together.(12--3)
Malcolm, you worked on the Spaceport project?(12--3)
My company was the contractor.(12--3)
I built the theater there(12--3)
with my own two hands, practically.(12--3)
I understand.(12--3)
Well,(12--3)
I'm glad to see you two guys getting along so well(12--3)
because, Danny,(12--3)
Malcolm is on the TOPS team.(12--3)
He's going to be working with you for a while.(12--3)
His experience will be valuable to both of us.(12--3)
Welcome aboard, Malcolm!(12--3)
I'm going back to my office.(12--3)
Give me a call later, Malcolm.(12--3)
I'll tell you the time and date of the next TOPS meeting.(12--3)
I'd like you to meet the group.(12--3)
I will, John.(12--3)
And again--thanks.(12--3)
No ... thank you.(12--3)
And thank Susan.(12--3)
He's quite a man.(12--3)
A real inspiration for me.(12--3)
OK, Danny.(12--3)
I know you didn't expect to have me around,(12--3)
but I think I can be of some help to you.(12--3)
Let me tell you something, Malcolm.(12--3)
With your background and experience,(12--3)
I can learn something(12--3)
...and I do need some advice on a difficult problem.(12--3)
Let me show you this.(12--3)
I don't want to give you a final opinion(12--3)
without studying these building plans more carefully.(12--3)
But a simple solution might be(12--3)
to move the air-conditioning units(12--3)
instead of redesigning the entire system.(12--3)
It might be simpler and less expensive.(12--3)
You just earned your weight in gold, Malcolm.(12--3)
Welcome aboard!(12--3)
It all happened so quickly!(12--3)
I can't believe it!(12--3)
I'm glad Mr. Marchetta was so helpful.(12--3)
He was more than helpful.(12--3)
He actually took me to meet his foreman.(12--3)
I'm thrilled for you, Grandpa.(12--3)
I don't know how to thank you, Susan.(12--3)
You're a wonderful granddaughter.(12--3)
It's good to see you so happy.(12--3)
I'll be at the construction site tomorrow.(12--3)
What are you doing tomorrow night?(12--3)
I'm not doing anything.(12--3)
Why?(12--3)
How about a date with your grandfather?(12--3)
I owe you a good steak dinner.(12--3)
I'll accept.(12--3)
Tomorrow night.(12--3)
You and me. Dinner.(12--3)
What time?(12--3)
I'll pick you up here at seven.(12--3)
Is that OK?(12--3)
I can't wait!(12--3)
And you can tell me(12--3)
all about your first full day back on the job.(12--3)
It's a deal!(12--3)
There's nothing more joyous than the arrival of a new baby.(13--1)
I am so excited. Mother!(13--1)
Just imagine--Marilyn and Richard must be thrilled!(13--1)
Oh, a new baby!(13--1)
Max ... Max ... Max.(13--1)
Oh, it's a sweet-sounding name for a sweet little boy.(13--1)
My first grandchild.(13--1)
And my first nephew.(13--1)
Isn't he just adorable?(13--1)
He looks a lot like you, Mom. He does.(13--1)
Do you think so?(13--1)
Well, I guess. He does look a lot like Richard,(13--1)
and I guess he looks a lot like me.(13--1)
Oh, he's got Richard's eyes, though.(13--1)
I really want Harry and Michelle to see Max.(13--1)
When are they coming?(13--1)
Tomorrow. Harry has an account to work on today.(13--1)
Yes, he does have Richard's eyes. Big blue eyes.(13--1)
The baby even looks at you like Richard does.(13--1)
Well, children usually resemble their parents.(13--1)
It's true.(13--1)
Michelle is a lot like Harry in so many ways.(13--1)
And she's shy with new people, just like he is.(13--1)
You really like Michelle, don't you?(13--1)
Yes. I'm very fond of her.(13--1)
And Harry, too?(13--1)
Well ...(13--1)
Uh, it's four-thirty. Oh my!(13--1)
Marilyn and Richard will be home from the hospital any minute,(13--1)
and we must prepare this room.(13--1)
Where will we put all the presents?(13--1)
Well, let's take everything to the living room.(13--1)
Marilyn and Richard and the baby need the space.(13--1)
It's crowded in here.(13--1)
The welcome sign is up:(13--1)
"Welcome home, Max."(13--1)
Isn't it exciting, Grandpa?(13--1)
Your first great-grandchild.(13--1)
Yes. Yes, sir.(13--1)
A great-grandchild. A great-grandson.(13--1)
Another generation to carry on the Stewart name.(13--1)
I love you, Grandpa.(13--1)
You make me feel so proud to be part of our family.(13--1)
One day, you'll have your own family,(13--1)
and I'll be proud to be part of it.(13--1)
Now you understand my feelings, Susan.(13--1)
I'm Grandpa's daughter-in-law, but I feel like a Stewart.(13--1)
He's always made me feel like his own daughter.(13--1)
that's because you're so much like us--wonderful!(13--1)
Mom, got it.(13--1)
This will make a nice gift for Marilyn and Richard.(13--1)
They can keep a record of all of the important dates(13--1)
and information about Max's life here.(13--1)
Let's see.(13--1)
Name: Max Stewart.(13--1)
Does he have a middle name?(13--1)
No, just Max. I like that.(13--1)
No middle name. No middle initial.(13--1)
Like me. I'm Malcolm Stewart.(13--1)
Just Malcolm Stewart.(13--1)
And Max has your initials, Grandpa:M.S.(13--1)
Uh, it must mean something.(13--1)
Weight: eight pounds six ounces.(13--1)
Eight-six. Big boy!(13--1)
All the Stewart men were big.(13--1)
Well, Robbie was eight pounds two ounces,(13--1)
and Richard was eight pounds three.(13--1)
And me?(13--1)
Eight pounds six.(13--1)
You were big, just like Max.(13--1)
Eight pounds six, just like me.(13--1)
That's nice. Length. Length?(13--1)
Richard says Max is twenty-one inches long.(13--1)
Twenty-one inches.(13--1)
Is that tall or average or what?(13--1)
Tall. All the Stewart men are tall.(13--1)
Well, Grandpa, you're about five-nine or five-ten.(13--1)
I wouldn't call that tall.(13--1)
I take after my mother's family.(13--1)
They were...they were...they were average.(13--1)
Mother: Marilyn. Father: Richard.(13--1)
And lots of pages for Richard's photos of Max.(13--1)
Speaking of mother and of father(13--1)
--and speaking of Max--I hear the car.(13--1)
They're here!(13--1)
Oh!Oh,quickly!Go,go,go!(13--1)
Let's see. Oh, welcome home.(13--1)
Oh, let her in.(13--1)
Wait with your pictures for a second.(13--1)
Come on, darlings.(13--1)
Sweetheart .... Sit down right here.(13--1)
Oh, he's so cute! Oh, Marilyn!(13--1)
Max looks just like Grandpa.(13--1)
A real Stewart.(13--1)
I'm so happy to be home with my family--and with Max.(13--1)
It's almost ten o'clock.(13--2)
I've got to go. Tomorrow is Monday,(13--2)
and work begins at eight in the morning for me.(13--2)
Oh, I'm so happy that Max is home.(13--2)
He's the sweetest little thing.(13--2)
I'll drive you to the station, dear.(13--2)
You can catch the ten-twenty train to Grand Central Station.(13--2)
I'll drive Susan, dear.(13--2)
Thank you, Philip.(13--2)
Then Grandpa, Robbie,(13--2)
and I can finish wrapping all these gifts.(13--2)
It's so good to have you home again...(13--2)
and to see Max asleep in his bassinet at home with us.(13--2)
To be with our family and all that Stewart TLC.(13--2)
TLC--tender loving care.(13--2)
That's our motto.(13--2)
Did you see the washcloth(13--2)
and the towels with the teddy bears on them?(13--2)
Alexandra and the Molinas sent them for Max.(13--2)
It was so kind of them.(13--2)
Now Max has come into everyone's life.(13--2)
The house is so alive with him here.(13--2)
The welcome sign over the door.(13--2)
The boxes of presents.(13--2)
The M-A-X over his bassinet.(13--2)
Robbie put that there.(13--2)
Susan's teddy bear.(13--2)
So cuddly. The beautiful crib from Mom and Dad.(13--2)
Oh, and Grandpa's baseball glove.(13--2)
You know, it hung over my crib, too.(13--2)
And it hung over Robbie's crib.(13--2)
Part of Grandpa's magic?(13--2)
Oh, that's not all.(13--2)
It hung over Susan's crib.(13--2)
The same baseball glove?(13--2)
That's right. Grandpa hangs it there for good luck.(13--2)
He says it always brought him good luck on the baseball team.(13--2)
He believes it'll bring good luck to all the Stewart babies.(13--2)
And then he takes it back(13--2)
when Max is ready to use it?(13--2)
Yes,(13--2)
and replaces it with a new glove(13--2)
so the old one will be ready(13--2)
for a new member of the Stewart family.(13--2)
Grandpa really loves his family, doesn't he?(13--2)
So do I.(13--2)
And so do I.(13--2)
And so does Max.(13--2)
After he eats!(13--2)
Thanks, Michelle.(13--3)
I hope you like it.(13--3)
Isn't this baby outfit adorable?(13--3)
With his name on it--"Max."(13--3)
Thanks so much, Harry and Michelle.(13--3)
We really appreciate it.(13--3)
I'm glad you like it.(13--3)
Michelle picked it out.(13--3)
Yes, I told Daddy to pick blue ones.(13--3)
Blue is for boys, and pink is for girls.(13--3)
And Max is some boy.(13--3)
He's a real Stewart.(13--3)
Right.(13--3)
That was so thoughtful of you, Michelle.(13--3)
Especially to pick it out in blue.(13--3)
Would you like to see baby Max, Michelle?(13--3)
Could she? Could we?(13--3)
Could I?(13--3)
Take them upstairs, Susan.(13--3)
Harry and Michelle can watch Max sleeping.(13--3)
Let's go.(13--3)
Come on, Michelle.(13--3)
Before Max wakes up.(13--3)
Will you please take this upstairs, Susan?(13--3)
Uh-huh.(13--3)
Thank you.(13--3)
Michelle is very grown up for a ten-year-old, huh?(13--3)
She's smart and sensitive for her age.(13--3)
Growing up without a mother is difficult.(13--3)
You mature quickly.(13--3)
Susan's like a mother to Michelle.(13--3)
They have a good relationship.(13--3)
Do you think Susan and Harry will get married?(13--3)
Yeah. You can count on it.(13--3)
I think so. Yes. They get along so well.(13--3)
I like him. He's good for Susan.(13--3)
He's a little quiet.(13--3)
It's hard to do anything but listen in this family.(13--3)
How can anybody get a word in around here?(13--3)
You're right, Ellen.(13--3)
Oh, really?(13--3)
It's the way it should be.(13--3)
The Stewarts are the Stewarts!(13--3)
They always were,(13--3)
and they always will be.(13--3)
Right!(13--3)
They've always got an opinion.(13--3)
Always got something to say.(13--3)
And now there's Max Stewart.(13--3)
and if he talks as loudly as he cries,(13--3)
we're all in for trouble.(13--3)
He's quiet now.(13--3)
Mmm-hmm. That's because he's sleeping.(13--3)
He's really cute.(13--3)
It's not necessary to whisper, Harry.(13--3)
A baby gets used to voices.(13--3)
I remember now.(13--3)
We always whispered when Michelle was born.(13--3)
And I didn't sleep well, Daddy told me.(13--3)
I never slept.(13--3)
And when I did,(13--3)
I woke up when I heard someone speak.(13--3)
I bet you were cute.(13--3)
She sure was.(13--3)
Not as cute as Max.(13--3)
He's like a little doll.(13--3)
Oh, good.(13--3)
Now I can help diaper him.(13--3)
Let's get Marilyn.(13--3)
What do you do when he cries like that?(13--3)
You pick him up.(13--3)
He's so little...so new.(13--3)
Let's call Marilyn.(13--3)
Time for a feeding and time for a diapering.(13--3)
You're a real Stewart.(13--3)
You like living in New York, don't you?(14--1)
Oh, I love it.(14--1)
It's so convenient.(14--1)
I can take the bus to work...(14--1)
or the subway...(14--1)
or a taxi.(14--1)
And there's so much to do.(14--1)
Lots of movie houses, and the theater.(14--1)
I know what you mean.(14--1)
I'd like to live in the city,(14--1)
but living in New Jersey and the suburbs(14--1)
is better for Michelle.(14--1)
Trees, grass.(14--1)
There's a lot of good things about suburban living.(14--1)
I grew up in Riverdale, remember?(14--1)
So I know.(14--1)
But, as a working woman,(14--1)
I think New York has all the conveniences--(14--1)
including the best tomatoes.(14--1)
The truth is, I'd like to live in the city.(14--1)
Michelle's the right age.(14--1)
There are lots of things for her here.(14--1)
You're right, Harry.(14--1)
Today is the perfect example.(14--1)
Michelle and her friends are at the aquarium in Brooklyn.(14--1)
They come back here for lunch,(14--1)
then go uptown to the Museum of Natural History.(14--1)
There's so much for young people to see and do.(14--1)
It's just incredible!(14--1)
Not just for young people.(14--1)
What about me?(14--1)
I've never been to the aquarium(14--1)
or the Museum of Natural History. Have you?(14--1)
Oh yes, Harry.(14--1)
My mother and father(14--1)
often took us somewhere in the city on the weekends.(14--1)
Dad was a busy doctor,(14--1)
but he usually managed to squeeze a Sunday in(14--1)
with Richard, Robbie, and me.(14--1)
I used to love to go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.(14--1)
I've been there several times.(14--1)
Twice with Michelle.(14--1)
You ought to think about spending more time with Michelle(14--1)
at all the great places in the city.(14--1)
Well, perhaps,(14--1)
you'll help me select some of the great places.(14--1)
And perhaps, you'll join us?(14--1)
Perhaps I will.(14--1)
Well, there we are.(14--1)
All set for lunch, Harry.(14--1)
It looks inviting.(14--1)
I wish Michelle and her friends would get here.(14--1)
I'm starving, aren't you?(14--1)
I can't wait to take a bite of the pumpernickel.(14--1)
It smells so delicious.(14--1)
Coming! Coming!(14--1)
Who is it?(14--1)
Michelle.(14--1)
It's us, Susan.(14--1)
Come in, Michelle,(14--1)
and bring your friends along.(14--1)
We're on the fifth floor.(14--1)
Oh, you've been here before.(14--1)
Susan,(14--1)
I really appreciate(14--1)
your doing this for Michelle and her friends.(14--1)
Oh, please, Harry.(14--1)
It's nothing.(14--1)
I'm not just doing it for Michelle.(14--1)
I'm doing it for you.(14--1)
Thank you.(14--1)
I'm doing it for us, Harry.(14--1)
Well,(14--1)
it's...it's important for Michelle to see us together more often.(14--1)
That's true.(14--1)
It's important(14--1)
for Michelle and me to get to know each other better.(14--1)
That's important for us.(14--1)
That makes me feel good.(14--1)
What, Harry?(14--1)
What makes you feel good?(14--1)
Well, that you care about Michelle,(14--1)
that you care about me,and(14--1)
that you care about us.(14--1)
Well, Harry, that's because I do.(14--1)
I do care.(14--1)
They'll be here any minute.(14--1)
Susan, I'd like to continue this conversation later.(14--1)
Of course, Harry.(14--1)
We'll finish the conversation when they go to the museum.(14--1)
I'd like that.(14--1)
So would I.(14--1)
Oh, Daddy!(14--2)
We had such a good time at the aquarium.(14--2)
I saw a real shark.(14--2)
I could almost touch it.(14--2)
I'm so glad.(14--2)
Hi. Michelle,(14--2)
why don't you introduce everybody to Susan?(14--2)
Hi, Susan.(14--2)
I'd like you to meet Audrey and her mother, Mrs. Cooper.(14--2)
Hello, Audrey.(14--2)
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cooper.(14--2)
I'm Susan Stewart.(14--2)
And this is Shirley and Nicole.(14--2)
Hi, girls.(14--2)
Come on in.(14--2)
Come on in, Mrs. Cooper.(14--2)
Come on in, everybody.(14--2)
The aquarium was so exciting.(14--2)
I had never been there before.(14--2)
The girls learned a great deal.(14--2)
Frankly, so did I.(14--2)
Well, please sit down(14--2)
and tell us all about it during lunch.(14--2)
We prepared some tuna fish(14--2)
and cheese sandwiches for lunch.(14--2)
I love tuna fish.(14--2)
Don't you, Audrey?(14--2)
I remember when I used to be a Girl Scout.(14--2)
My mother would take us everywhere, too.(14--2)
Susan, I understand you're in the toy business.(14--2)
Yes, I am.(14--2)
My company manufactures toys and games for children.(14--2)
Susan's vice-president in charge of new toys and games.(14--2)
And the marketing of new toys and games.(14--2)
Can we test a new game for you, Susan?(14--2)
That's an excellent idea, Michelle.(14--2)
I happen to have(14--2)
a game which I brought home to study.(14--2)
Let us try it!(14--2)
Do you want to play?(14--2)
Nicole? Shirley? Audrey?(14--2)
We tested it last week on twelve- to fifteen-year-olds,(14--2)
and they found it to be too easy--(14--2)
in other words...boring.(14--2)
We think it might be just right for ten- to twelve-year-olds.(14--2)
That's us, Susan.(14--2)
First, you shuffle the deck(14--2)
and lay them face down.(14--2)
Then you select the leader.(14--2)
I'll be the leader.(14--2)
The leader takes the first ten cards(14--2)
and lays them face up on this stand.(14--2)
Everyone gets a turn, going counterclockwise,(14--2)
left to right.(14--2)
You have thirty seconds to make a word,(14--2)
using as many letters as possible.(14--2)
You get one point for each letter,(14--2)
plus the person with the longest word gets ten extra points.(14--2)
The first one to get one hundred points wins.(14--2)
That's easy.(14--2)
OK, let's go around the table.(14--2)
You first, Audrey.(14--2)
Good.(14--2)
That's five points.(14--2)
Next, Nicole.(14--2)
OK.(14--2)
That's five points also.(14--2)
It's your turn, Shirley.(14--2)
Creep.(14--2)
That's another five-letter word.(14--2)
Five points.(14--2)
So far, you're all tied.(14--2)
Sheet is a five-letter word.(14--2)
Michelle, your turn.(14--2)
Terrific!(14--2)
Michelle wins with a six-letter word,(14--2)
plus she gets an additional ten points(14--2)
for a total of sixteen points.(14--2)
How are you enjoying the game so far?(14--2)
I think it's too easy.(14--2)
Too easy?(14--2)
Michelle!(14--2)
It's OK, Harry.(14--2)
Michelle is quite right.(14--2)
She just said it's too easy.(14--2)
Well, I like the game.(14--2)
I enjoyed lunch, Susan.(14--2)
Thank you so much,(14--2)
but we have to get going(14--2)
to meet the rest of the troop at two o'clock at the museum.(14--2)
Oh, it was nice meeting all of you.(14--2)
I hope you have a wonderful time(14--2)
at the Museum of Natural History.(14--2)
Good-bye, everybody.(14--2)
Have a good time.(14--2)
Bye.(14--2)
See you in front of the museum at five o'clock.(14--2)
Oh, OK.(14--2)
Thanks, Mr. Bennett.(14--2)
That'll be fine.(14--2)
And thanks again for the lunch and for the game.(14--2)
Good-bye, Susan.(14--2)
It's not a bad game.(14--2)
It's just...slow.(14--2)
Just slow.(14--2)
You helped save our company a lot of money.(14--2)
Bye-bye.(14--2)
You are wonderful with kids.(14--2)
I am.(14--2)
Isn't there a conversation that we have to finish?(14--2)
There's a conversation we have to finish.(14--3)
What was it about?(14--3)
It was about caring.(14--3)
Oh?(14--3)
Yes, caring.(14--3)
I said that it makes me feel good(14--3)
that you care about Michelle.(14--3)
Well, I do care about Michelle.(14--3)
And it makes me feel good that you care about me.(14--3)
You know I do.(14--3)
You're a ... wonderful friend.(14--3)
And it makes me feel good(14--3)
that you care about us.(14--3)
Well ... well,(14--3)
I do, Harry.(14--3)
It's only natural that if I care about Michelle(14--3)
and I care about you,(14--3)
then I care about us.(14--3)
It's OK, Susan.(14--3)
We had this part of the conversation(14--3)
before Michelle and her friends arrived.(14--3)
Now comes the good part.(14--3)
Like what?(14--3)
Well, assume that if you care about Michelle(14--3)
and you care about me(14--3)
and you care about us,(14--3)
that we can talk about us.(14--3)
I mean--you and me.(14--3)
Isn't that right?(14--3)
What are you trying to say, Harry?(14--3)
What I'm trying to say...(14--3)
since this is so easy ....(14--3)
Here are ten letters that express my feelings for you.(14--3)
Don't be silly, Harry.(14--3)
You want a hint?(14--3)
It's two words.(14--3)
You're making the game harder.(14--3)
Can't you figure it out?(14--3)
Seven letters...two words...(14--3)
that express the feelings that I feel for you in my heart.(14--3)
Harry, I get it!(14--3)
Well? Does that mean you'll marry me?(14--3)
Is that a proposal, or are we just playing a game?(14--3)
Sit down, Susan.(14--3)
There's something I have to ask you.(14--3)
Susan, will you marry me?(14--3)
It's such an important decision.(14--3)
There's so many things to talk about.(14--3)
There are three things that have to be done first, Harry.(14--3)
Three things?(14--3)
First, we have to decide where to live.(14--3)
Well, that's easy.(14--3)
We talked about that earlier.(14--3)
We'll live in New York.(14--3)
All right.(14--3)
Second,(14--3)
we have to talk to Michelle together about being married.(14--3)
We'll do that immediately.(14--3)
What's the third thing?(14--3)
You have to ask for my father's permission.(14--3)
Absolutely!(14--3)
But first things first.(14--3)
We have to go pick up Michelle.(14--3)
Oh, I'm so happy, Harry!(14--3)
Not as happy as I am.(14--3)
What's this for?(15--1)
Just because. How's the baby?(15--1)
Fast asleep.(15--1)
I'm sorry I missed him.(15--1)
I had to work late.(15--1)
What are the flowers for, Richard?(15--1)
Five years of happiness. Happy anniversary.(15--1)
But our anniversary isn't until Saturday.(15--1)
I couldn't wait.(15--1)
Besides, we are not going to be here Saturday.(15--1)
We're not?(15--1)
Uh-uh.(15--1)
Where are we going to be?(15--1)
If you had your choice of all the places in the world.(15--1)
where would you choose to spend our anniversary?(15--1)
The Watermill Inn.(15--1)
I loved that place when we went on our honeymoon.(15--1)
Perfect! You picked the right place.(15--1)
I don't understand.(15--1)
You and I, Mrs. Stewart,(15--1)
are going to spend a second honeymoon at the Watermill Inn.(15--1)
Oh, Richard! That's wonderful, but--(15--1)
No buts.(15--1)
What about the baby?(15--1)
Aren't we taking the baby on our honeymoon?(15--1)
Absolutely not.(15--1)
The world's greatest grandmother, Mrs. Ellen Stewart,(15--1)
has agreed to take care of him for the weekend.(15--1)
Richard, isn't that too much to ask of your mother?(15--1)
Too much? She loves taking care of Max.(15--1)
But...I'll miss him.(15--1)
Well, we'll phone every hour,(15--1)
and you can listen to him over the phone.(15--1)
Come on, Mar.(15--1)
It's time you and I had a romantic weekend alone together.(15--1)
We've earned it. What do you say?(15--1)
It does sound tempting.(15--1)
You're right. We've earned it.(15--1)
Great!I'll make a reservation right now.(15--1)
Remember that wonderful little balcony(15--1)
where we had our meals...(15--1)
with a view of the Hudson River?(15--1)
How could I forget?(15--1)
Hello. Is Mrs. Montefiore there?(15--1)
Ah. She's out.(15--1)
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.(15--1)
My wife and I spent our honeymoon at the inn.(15--1)
No, we didn't leave anything in the room.(15--1)
It's five years ago.(15--1)
We'd like to make a reservation for this weekend.(15--1)
Yes, a double room, please.(15--1)
What?(15--1)
Are you sure? But ... OK.(15--1)
Nothing available.(15--1)
Wait! Don't hang up!(15--1)
Can you recommend someplace nice--someplace nearby?(15--1)
Uh--hold it. Old Country Inn?(15--1)
Right. And the phone number?(15--1)
555-2420. Thank you.(15--1)
He says there's another inn(15--1)
just half a mile down the road from the Watermill.(15--1)
It won't be the same, but what do you say?(15--1)
Well ...(15--1)
My mom is available to baby-sit this weekend.(15--1)
Well, OK. See if they have a room.(15--1)
Right!(15--1)
Hello. Is this the Old Country Inn?(15--1)
Yes. This is Richard Stewart.(15--1)
The desk clerk at the Watemill suggested your inn.(15--1)
Would you happen to have a room for two availbale(15--1)
this weekend? (15--1)
Something really nice.(15--1)
My wife and I are celebrating our fifth anniversary.(15--1)
Yes. I'll hold. He's checking. You do?(15--1)
Great! What is the daily rate?(15--1)
That's fine. Thank you.(15--1)
Yes,we'll be arriving by car about ten o'clock Friday night.(15--1)
Stewart. S-t-e-w-a-r-t. Thank you.(15--1)
Done! You and I, Mrs. Stewart.(15--1)
are going to have a wonderful, romantic weekend!(15--1)
Richard, that's the baby.(15--1)
Right this way, Mr. and Mrs. Stewart.(15--2)
Well, it's small, but clean.(15--2)
Clean? You call this clean?(15--2)
Have a nice stay.(15--2)
Thank you. I don't believe this.(15--2)
Well, it isn't the Watermill Inn,(15--2)
but let's get a look at the view.(15--2)
How is the view?(15--2)
Great,(15--2)
if you enjoy looking at a parking lot.(15--2)
Well, maybe we'll see the view in the morning.(15--2)
Right now, we should clean up this room.(15--2)
Sorry, Marilyn.(15--2)
Why should you be sorry?(15--2)
Well,the rain,the room,the view of the parking lot.(15--2)
It isn't the way I hoped it would be.(15--2)
Stop blaming yourself.(15--2)
After all, we're here, we're alone, we're together.(15--2)
And I love you. Isn't that enough?(15--2)
It is for me,(15--2)
but I wanted this weekend to be special for you.(15--2)
It is special. Happy anniversary.(15--2)
It's still raining. I want to play tennis.(15--2)
I want some breakfast.(15--2)
Let's call room service and order a nice breakfast,(15--2)
and then we'll figure out what to do today.(15--2)
Right.(15--2)
Would you give me room service, please?(15--2)
I beg your pardon? Oh, I see.(15--2)
They don't have room service at Old Country Inn.(15--2)
Well, let's go down to the coffee shop.(15--2)
They don't have a coffee shop.(15--2)
We can get our meals at Mrs.Montefiore's down the road.(15--2)
That's OK, honey.(15--2)
I love walking in the rain.(15--2)
Oh,you're being a really good sport about this, Marilyn,(15--2)
but I think we should face the truth.(15--2)
What's that?(15--2)
This is not the way to spend our fifth anniversary.(15--2)
Well, what do you want to do?(15--2)
Why don't we get in the car and drive home?(15--2)
Oh, Richard, it really isn't that bad.(15--2)
Do you want to stick it out for the whole weekend?(15--2)
Well, I'll admit the room is uncomfortable.(15--2)
Uh-hum.(15--2)
And I do feel bad about your mother(15--2)
having to take care of the baby all weekend.(15--2)
Why don't we just check out?(15--2)
OK.(15--2)
Hello? Yes. Yes, this is she.(15--2)
Oh, hello! How nice of you to remember us!(15--2)
Yes, my husband did call.(15--2)
You do? Really? It won't be any trouble?(15--2)
Oh,yes,I think we'd like that very much.(15--2)
Fifteen minutes! Thank you. Good-bye.(15--2)
You will never guess.(15--2)
Uh ... I give up.(15--2)
Mrs. Montefiore from the Watermill Inn.(15--2)
What is she calling about?(15--2)
They have an opening.(15--2)
Someone just checked out.(15--2)
and Mrs. Montefiore has reserved the honeymoon suite for us.(15--2)
You're kidding!(15--2)
No. Isn't it wonderful?(15--2)
It's fantastic!(15--2)
Oh. Now all it has to do is stop raining.(15--2)
Let's go.(15--2)
Welcome to the Watermill Inn.(15--3)
Oh, Richard,(15--3)
it's exactly as it was when we were married!(15--3)
And when I got married.(15--3)
Even the old patchwork quilt is the same!(15--3)
My great-grandmother made that quilt(15--3)
when Teddy Roosevelt was President.(15--3)
In those days, when they made quilts.(15--3)
they cut patches(15--3)
from the old clothing of every member in the family(15--3)
so that each one would be a part of it.(15--3)
What a lovely tradition!(15--3)
Thank you for calling us.(15--3)
I remember you and your wife(15--3)
from the first time you stayed with us.(15--3)
We were very young.(15--3)
And very much in love.(15--3)
We have a baby now.(15--3)
How wonderful! A boy or a girl?(15--3)
A boy--Max.(15--3)
Do you have a picture?(15--3)
Would a professional photographer be without a picture?(15--3)
Oh, he's adorable!(15--3)
And very bright.(15--3)
Like his father. A real Stewart.(15--3)
And very good-looking, like his mother.(15--3)
Well, it's nice to have you with us again.(15--3)
Next time, bring the baby.(15--3)
You see, Richard? Max is welcome here.(15--3)
Not on our anniversary.(15--3)
This vacation is for you and me.(15--3)
If there's anything you need, please call me.(15--3)
I'll be in the front office all day.(15--3)
Oh,I took the liberty of ordering some breakfast for you.(15--3)
Just put it over there, Charles.(15--3)
Thank you, Charles.(15--3)
Compliments of the Watermill Inn.(15--3)
Thank you.(15--3)
Thank you so much.(15--3)
Now, this is my idea of a good time.(15--3)
Let's see...hotcakes and maple syrup,with scrambled eggs.(15--3)
Umm...smell that coffee...cinnamon and cloves.(15--3)
Homemade buttermilk biscuits.(15--3)
Slices of orange with burnt honey.(15--3)
Let's eat!(15--3)
First I want to call home(15--3)
and check on your mother and the baby.(15--3)
Honey, if there were any problems,(15--3)
she would call us.(15--3)
She doesn't know we've changed hotels.(15--3)
You're right. Of course.(15--3)
Hello, operator.(15--3)
I'd like to call Riverdale, New York.(15--3)
This food is heavenly, isn't it?(15--3)
This whole place is heavenly.(15--3)
Do you remember that old desk?(15--3)
Mrs. Montefiore told me that(15--3)
George Washington sat at that desk(15--3)
and wrote to his wife Martha.(15--3)
What do you want to do after breakfast?(15--3)
Why don't we take a walk down to the river?(15--3)
In the rain?(15--3)
No. Look out the window. The sun is shining!(15--3)
Now this is my idea of a good time!(15--3)
The mailman just dropped some mail in our box, Grandpa.(16--1)
Probably a lot of advertising and bills.(16--1)
Why don't you write to me, Robbie, (16--1)
so I can get some interesting mail?(16--1)
You were right, Grandpa.(16--1)
Advertising,bills,bills,advertising.(16--1)
Yes. It's just like I said, Robbie.(16--1)
Nothing interesting.(16--1)
You won't believe it, Grandpa,(16--1)
but there's a letter here addressed to you,(16--1)
Mr. Malcolm Stewart,and it looks like a personal letter.(16--1)
Oh, it must be a bill.(16--1)
I don't think so.(16--1)
The return name and address is Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.(16--1)
You're joking. Pete Waters?(16--1)
Pete Waters, RFD Number 1, Chesterton.(16--1)
You know him?(16--1)
Do I know Pete Waters?(16--1)
You bet I do!(16--1)
He was my roommate in college.(16--1)
He visited with Grandma and me in Florida about five years ago.(16--1)
What does he say?(16--1)
Is he OK?(16--1)
Yeah, he's fine.(16--1)
Just fine.(16--1)
He's writing to invite me to spend a weekend with him at his farm.(16--1)
He's planning a get-together with two or three other college friends.(16--1)
A kind of a fifty-year anniversary reunion.(16--1)
Sounds like fun.(16--1)
Fifty years? Wow!(16--1)
It sounds like fun to me, too, Robbie.(16--1)
What kind of farm does he have?(16--1)
I've never been there, Robbie,(16--1)
but he has chickens and cows and all.(16--1)
That means fresh eggs and fresh milk.(16--1)
Does he have a family?(16--1)
No, he doesn't, Robbie.(16--1)
He never married.(16--1)
He's not as lucky as I am to have a family and grandchildren.(16--1)
I'm a lucky man.(16--1)
How come he never got married?(16--1)
That's a good question, Robbie.(16--1)
A very good question.(16--1)
He never married (16--1)
because the girl he was in love with in college married someone else.(16--1)
As simple as that.(16--1)
He never got over it.(16--1)
He must have loved her very much.(16--1)
Yes. Very much.(16--1)
Lillian Winters.(16--1)
She was in our class.(16--1)
And what happened?(16--1)
She was in love with Donald McGrath,(16--1)
the quarterback on our football team.(16--1)
Football players are always popular with the ladies.(16--1)
She liked Pete, and they went to dances together.(16--1)
But her heart was with Donald.(16--1)
Did he ever get over it?(16--1)
No, he never did.(16--1)
Where is she today?(16--1)
I don't know.(16--1)
Maybe Lillian will be at the reunion.(16--1)
You think so?(16--1)
Pete's full of surprises.(16--1)
I wish I could go there with you, Grandpa.(16--1)
What do you think the surprise will be?(16--1)
With Pete, you never know, Robbie.(16--1)
Won't it be exciting to see all your college friends there again?(16--1)
It is already.(16--1)
I'm kind of excited about going now.(16--1)
Next weekend ...(16--1)
sleep over Friday and Saturday night and come back Sunday.(16--1)
I can't wait!(16--1)
Don't you think you ought to call Pete and tell him you're coming?(16--1)
You're reading my mind, Robbie.(16--1)
Hello. What can I do for you?(16--2)
Hi. Fill 'er up.(16--2)
I need a full tank.(16--2)
Check the hood?(16--2)
No, thanks.(16--2)
Whereabouts are you headed?(16--2)
Pete Waters's farm, near Chesterton.(16--2)
I know it well.(16--2)
Pete Waters's lived around here almost as long as I have.(16--2)
How long is it going to take for me to get there?(16--2)
About fifteen minutes.(16--2)
There's a shortcut--if you know it.(16--2)
No, I don't.(16--2)
Could you tell me how to use the shortcut?(16--2)
Sure. You take the next left turn.(16--2)
You'll see a stop sign.(16--2)
Make a right at the stop sign.(16--2)
Stay on that road, and you'll cross a blue bridge.(16--2)
Then you'll see a big old red barn.(16--2)
That's the back of Pete Waters's place.(16--2)
That's quite a difference from the directions that Pete sent me.(16--2)
Now,if you take that route,(16--2)
it's probably a lot simpler,(16--2)
but it'll take you ten minutes longer.(16--2)
OK. Let me repeat it.(16--2)
I take the next left turn to the stop sign.(16--2)
Then a right across a blue bridge,(16--2)
and then a big red barn.(16--2)
Can't miss it.(16--2)
How much do I owe you?(16--2)
Well, that'll be eighteen dollars and seventy cents.(16--2)
No charge for the cleanup.(16--2)
It's on the house.(16--2)
Well, here's a twenty.(16--2)
Ah. OK. That's a dollar and thirty cents change.(16--2)
There we go ... will make twenty. Thanks.(16--2)
Thank you.(16--2)
And thanks for the directions.(16--2)
This must be Pete's barn.(16--2)
Turn right to the house.(16--2)
Hi.(16--2)
Hi. What can I do for you?(16--2)
Is this the Pete Waters farm?(16--2)
It is.(16--2)
I'm a friend of Pete's.(16--2)
I'm looking for the house.(16--2)
It's just over yonder.(16--2)
Keep along this road till you get to the end of the fence.(16--2)
You'll see the chicken house.(16--2)
His house is on the left.(16--2)
Well, thanks.(16--2)
"Have gone to the railroad station.(16--2)
Back soon with a surprise.(16--2)
Make yourself at home.(16--2)
Have a look around. Pete."(16--2)
Same old Pete Waters.(16--2)
Always full of surprises.(16--2)
Don't tell me.(16--3)
Please don't tell me.(16--3)
I recognize you ...(16--3)
Oh, don't be silly, Arnie.(16--3)
Of course you recognize him.(16--3)
Except for the beard, he hasn't changed in fifty years.(16--3)
It's Malcolm Stewart!(16--3)
I know it's Malcolm Stewart.(16--3)
You haven't changed much in fifty years.(16--3)
Peggy--Peggy Pendleton!(16--3)
You're Peggy Pendleton!(16--3)
Who am I, you old rascal?(16--3)
You don't recognize me, do you?(16--3)
I know who you are.(16--3)
You're Arnold Franklin!(16--3)
I know who you are!(16--3)
You look wonderful, Malcolm!(16--3)
Sit down. Sit down.(16--3)
Pete isn't home.(16--3)
Really?(16--3)
No. He left a note on the door saying he was going to the railroad station to pick up a surprise.(16--3)
He's so funny.(16--3)
Always full of surprises, (16--3)
even fifty years later.(16--3)
The two of you look unbelievable!(16--3)
How's your family?(16--3)
Oh, I was sorry to hear about your wife having passed away.(16--3)
Yes. About four years ago.(16--3)
And you're living with your children now? In New York?(16--3)
Pete wrote us and told us.(16--3)
Yup.(16--3)
Retired and moved to New York to live with my son and his family.(16--3)
By the way, what do you think this big surprise is?(16--3)
It could be almost anything, knowing Pete.(16--3)
Hey, that must be Pete!(16--3)
Now we'll find out about the surprise.(16--3)
So good to see you all!(16--3)
Oh, Pete, Pete!(16--3)
Oh, it's so good to see you!(16--3)
Remember Lillian?(16--3)
I remember all of you.(16--3)
You haven't changed a bit.(16--3)
Lillian! Oh, my gosh!(16--3)
Lillian Winters.(16--3)
We were together in the Thursday night drama society.(16--3)
Remember me, Malcolm?(16--3)
Oh, beautiful as ever, Lillian.(16--3)
How's Donald?(16--3)
That's OK, Malcolm.(16--3)
Donald passed away a couple of years ago.(16--3)
Sorry to hear that, Lillian.(16--3)
Oh, I'm so sorry.(16--3)
I would not have missed this get-together for the world!(16--3)
And your little surprise, Pete?(16--3)
You really surprised me(16--3)
by having us all come together.(16--3)
You don't know what the surprise is yet?(16--3)
Come on!(16--3)
We'll tell you the big surprise.(16--3)
I've invited you here for the weekend to help celebrate.(16--3)
Celebrate?(16--3)
Our fiftieth reunion?(16--3)
No.(16--3)
No. Pete wants to tell you...(16--3)
Now, let me have the honor, Lillian.(16--3)
For goodness' sake, Pete, tell us!(16--3)
I can't wait much longer.(16--3)
Well, I am pouring this iced tea(16--3)
so that we can toast Lillian--and me.(16--3)
You don't mean to tell me that you and...(16--3)
Yes, I do.(16--3)
I have loved Lillian all these years,(16--3)
so I asked her to be Mrs. Pete Waters.(16--3)
And I said yes.(16--3)
I knew it! I knew it!(16--3)
Congratulations!(16--3)
Oh, Lillian,(16--3)
I am so happy for you both.(16--3)
It's wonderful!(16--3)
It's wonderful for me.(16--3)
Lillian will make me a happy man--finally.(16--3)
You are full of surprises, Pete.(16--3)
We are going to spend the entire weekend having a good time together here on the farm.(16--3)
We are going to celebrate all weekend.(16--3)
When is the wedding?(16--3)
That's another surprise.(16--3)
Lillian and I were married two weeks ago in Detroit.(16--3)
She's come here to stay.(16--3)
Wait till I tell my family about this!(16--3)
Why, that's wonderful!(16--3)
What are you doing?(17--1)
I think I've got them.(17--1)
You think you've got what?(17--1)
Performing arts--performing arts centers.(17--1)
I think I've got them all, but I'm not sure.(17--1)
I think you have got it, Richard.(17--1)
Lincoln Center,home of the Metropolitan Opera,(17--1)
the New York City Ballet,the New York Philharmonic.(17--1)
Shubert Alley,center of the theater on Broadway.(17--1)
And Carnegie Hall.(17--1)
And the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.(17--1)
And the Music Center in Los Angeles.(17--1)
And the others. I do have it all.(17--1)
You have been working on this for some time,Richard.(17--1)
I'm glad you feel you've finally put it all together.(17--1)
What now?(17--1)
Now for the hard part.(17--1)
Oh,you think you're going to have a hard time getting the album published?(17--1)
Well, it won't be easy.(17--1)
So,what do you think you're going to do?(17--1)
Does the name Harvey Carlson ring a bell?(17--1)
Oh, yes! Harvey Carlson! I remember.(17--1)
He said I should call him.(17--1)
He's the publisher of the Carlson Publishing Company.(17--1)
He said they need a new book of photographs,(17--1)
and he really liked my concept.(17--1)
So, why don't you call him in the morning?(17--1)
Do you think I have enough to show him?(17--1)
I've been through every section with you, Richard.(17--1)
It's quite complete.(17--1)
And now that you're satisfied with the performing arts section,(17--1)
I think you should show it to Mr. Carlson.(17--1)
You're right.My Family Album,U.S.A.feels right.(17--1)
I'll call in the morning and set up an appointment to see him.(17--1)
He's going to love your work.(17--1)
Come on. Let's get some sleep.(17--1)
Is it too early to call Mr. Carlson?(17--1)
Seven after nine?No.I'm sure he's in his office.(17--1)
His number is five,five,five,seven,five,three,two.(17--1)
Five,five,five,seven,five,three,two.(17--1)
Hello. Mr. Carlson, please.(17--1)
Mr. Carlson is busy at the moment.May I help you?(17--1)
I'd like to make an appointment with him.(17--1)
And your name is...?(17--1)
My name is Richard Stewart.(17--1)
He told me to call him about my project, Family Album, U.S.A.(17--1)
One moment, please.(17--1)
What's going on?(17--1)
I guess they're trying to set up an appointment for me.(17--1)
Mr. Stewart,I just spoke to Mr. Carlson.(17--1)
He would like to see you.(17--1)
But the only time he's available this week is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.(17--1)
Thanks. Thanks a lot. Good-bye.(17--1)
Well,it's done.Tomorrow morning at a publisher's office.(17--1)
Oh, it's so exciting, isn't it, Richard?(17--1)
Well, finally a publisher will see my work.(17--1)
Good morning.(17--2)
Good morning.My name is Richard Stewart.(17--2)
I'm here to see Mr. Carlson.(17--2)
Please sit down, Mr. Stewart.(17--2)
Mr. Carlson will be with you shortly.(17--2)
Thank you.(17--2)
Excuse me, Mr. Carlson,(17--2)
but Richard Stewart is here for his ten o'clock appointment with you.(17--2)
OK. Thank you.(17--2)
Like I said,he'll be with you shortly.(17--2)
Thank you.(17--2)
Yes, Mr. Carlson. Yes, sir.(17--2)
He's ready for you, Mr. Stewart.(17--2)
Thank you. In there?(17--2)
Yes. In there. Good luck.(17--2)
Come in, come in.(17--2)
This is a crazy morning.Hello,Richard.(17--2)
Hello, Mr. Carlson.(17--2)
Sit down, sit down.(17--2)
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.(17--2)
I hope you've brought your pictures along.(17--2)
I see that you have.Let's get right to it.(17--2)
We need a new coffee-table book,(17--2)
and a book of photos about the United States still feels right.(17--2)
OK, let's take a look.(17--2)
Good.Very good.Family Album, U.S.A.(17--2)
It's an excellent title.(17--2)
If you had to describe the book in one sentence,(17--2)
how would you do it?(17--2)
Well,I'd describe it as a book which is a ...(17--2)
a portrait of the United States--(17--2)
the places, the people--mostly the people.(17--2)
The things they do, (17--2)
the ways they live,(17--2)
the places they visit, (17--2)
and the landmarks.(17--2)
A photographic journey.(17--2)
These are wonderful--(17--2)
these photos in your performing arts section.(17--2)
Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center.(17--2)
I'm glad you like them.(17--2)
I do,but...(17--2)
But?(17--2)
There's something missing. (17--2)
You've got a good eye, Richard.(17--2)
You're a terrific photographer.(17--2)
But before I can publish your work,(17--2)
I need to meet with my marketing department,(17--2)
and you've got to do one more thing.(17--2)
What's that, Mr. Carlson?(17--2)
In the section on culture,(17--2)
you've included performing arts centers,(17--2)
but you've left out street performance.(17--2)
The mimes.The musicians.The dancers--in the parks and on the streets.(17--2)
Richard, if you go out and photograph street performances in the city,(17--2)
you'll have it.(17--2)
That is a great idea.(17--2)
The performing arts centers and the street performances.(17--2)
I'll do it.(17--2)
If you do it, I'll publish your work.(17--2)
Are you serious?(17--2)
I've never been more serious.(17--2)
When do you think you can return with street performances?(17--2)
A couple of weeks.(17--2)
If they're as good as the rest of these pictures, it's a deal.(17--2)
You won't be disappointed,Mr. Carlson.Thanks.(17--2)
Good-bye,Richard,and good luck.See you in two weeks.(17--2)
Good-bye, Mr. Carlson. Thanks.(17--2)
So if you like the street-performance photos,(17--2)
you'll really publish Family Album, U.S.A.?(17--2)
When I say something,I mean it.(17--2)
Go to work. Good-bye.(17--2)
Good-bye.(17--2)
Two weeks.I said I could do it in two weeks,and I did it.(17--3)
The pictures you've taken are fabulous, Richard.(17--3)
Mr. Carlson will love them.(17--3)
Monday morning.(17--3)
I'm going to show him the photos on Monday morning.(17--3)
I can't wait!(17--3)
I'm very proud of you.(17--3)
You really did a beautiful job.(17--3)
I know he will love the new photographs for your book.(17--3)
Yeah.I really did do a good job,didn't I?(17--3)
Hey,you know?(17--3)
There's still some film left on this roll,(17--3)
and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.(17--3)
Who?(17--3)
You.(17--3)
Richard! I haven't brushed my hair.(17--3)
You look great!(17--3)
It's not fair, Richard. (17--3)
I'm not even ready.(17--3)
Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!(17--3)
Wonderful!(17--3)
Thanks.(17--3)
Fabulous!(17--3)
Thanks.(17--3)
Terrific!(17--3)
Thanks.(17--3)
They get better and better.(17--3)
Thanks a lot.(17--3)
This is sensational!(17--3)
Yeah. Thanks.(17--3)
What a job! Good work, Richard!(17--3)
I'm so glad you like them so much.(17--3)
Like them? They represent your best work.(17--3)
Really?(17--3)
Absolutely.(17--3)
Well...what do you think? Do I have my book?(17--3)
You do. You do. There's a book here.(17--3)
I'll have a contract and an advance payment waiting for you first thing in the morning.(17--3)
Thank you.(17--3)
And while you're here, I would like to introduce you to your editor.(17--3)
And I want you to meet the people in the art department.(17--3)
I'll set up an appointment with the marketing people.(17--3)
When do you think we'll be through?(17--3)
In about half an hour. Why?(17--3)
I can't wait to tell Marilyn!(17--3)
I don't believe it!(18--1)
What's wrong?(18--1)
Carter Boswell!(18--1)
Who's Carter Boswell?(18--1)
He's running for the school board.(18--1)
The election's next month.(18--1)
What's wrong with wanting to be on the school board?(18--1)
Nothing.(18--1)
But he wants to cut the school budget!(18--1)
Maybe it needs cutting.(18--1)
Cutting the budget is fine,(18--1)
but he wants to do it(18--1)
by cutting all the cultural programs.(18--1)
No music, no dance,(18--1)
no concert,no stage presentations.(18--1)
Why does he want to do that?(18--1)
He says it's to save the taxpayers' money,(18--1)
and I think he believes(18--1)
that the taxpayers will vote for him(18--1)
if he spends less on the cultural programs.(18--1)
He's probably right.(18--1)
Lots of people want their taxes(18--1)
used for new books(18--1)
and a new paint job in the schoolrooms.(18--1)
Maybe some of us would like to pay a little bit more(18--1)
and keep the cultural programs for our kids.(18--1)
Well, I'm not sure. Ellen.(18--1)
I hear it from my patients.(18--1)
Lots of people are tired of higher taxes.(18--1)
I know,(18--1)
but if Boswell wins(18--1)
he'll be an important decision-maker(18--1)
on the school board,(18--1)
and he doesn't know anything(18--1)
about our children's education.(18--1)
Who's running against him?(18--1)
Nobody. That's the problem.(18--1)
Well, it sounds to me like Carter Boswell(18--1)
is going to win this seat on the board.(18--1)
Oh, not if I can stop him!(18--1)
And how are you going to stop him?(18--1)
I don't know.(18--1)
Maybe I'll run against him.(18--1)
Well, you've got my vote.(18--1)
I'm serious, Philip.(18--1)
Why shouldn't I run?(18--1)
Why shouldn't you run for what,Mom?(18--1)
Your mother is thinking of(18--1)
running for the school board.(18--1)
Hey, that's terrific, Mom!(18--1)
Against Carter Boswell?(18--1)
Great!(18--1)
Well, if I run for office,(18--1)
the voters will have a clear choice.(18--1)
I stand for everything Boswell doesn't.(18--1)
I think a lot of people will vote for you(18--1)
against Boswell, Ellen.(18--1)
I'll vote for you.(18--1)
Will you help me if I do run?(18--1)
Absolutely.(18--1)
The trouble is(18--1)
it takes a little bit of money to run a campaign.(18--1)
I think you can make a difference,Ellen.(18--1)
And in a short campaign(18--1)
you wouldn't need as much money.(18--1)
You know something, Ellen?(18--1)
Why not give the people of Riverdale a clear choice?(18--1)
I'm with you.(18--1)
You can make a difference.(18--1)
Come in.(18--1)
Mr. Maxwell?(18--1)
Yes, Charles Maxwell.(18--1)
My name is Ellen Stewart.(18--1)
Hello.(18--1)
Please, sit down.(18--1)
You asked to see me.(18--1)
What would you like to see me about?(18--1)
I'd like your help.(18--1)
Well,(18--1)
I'm editor of the most influential newspaper in Riverdale.(18--1)
Actually, it's the only newspaper.(18--1)
A lot of people would like my help.(18--1)
Do you have a story?(18--1)
I'm planning to run for the school board.(18--1)
Against Carter Boswell?(18--1)
Yes.(18--1)
Well, that is news.(18--1)
Will you announce that I'm running?(18--1)
Sure.(18--1)
But I need some information.(18--1)
Of course.(18--1)
Why will the voters vote for you against Boswell,(18--1)
Mrs. Stewart?(18--1)
Because I care.(18--1)
"Vote for Ellen Stewart. She cares."(18--1)
Not a bad slogan.(18--1)
But what do you care about?(18--1)
Well, I care about the children of our town.(18--1)
I don't want them to grow up(18--1)
without cultural programs in our school.(18--1)
Do you have a plan?(18--1)
I want our children to learn(18--1)
more than reading, writing, and arithmetic.(18--1)
I want to keep the after-school programs--(18--1)
the music, the concerts.(18--1)
It's not a bad plan.(18--1)
But who's going to pay for all of this?(18--1)
We are.(18--1)
The citizens of Riverdale, of course.(18--1)
I plan to get help(18--1)
from the businessmen and the corporations of Riverdale.(18--1)
That's fair enough.(18--1)
Exactly what do you want from me, Mrs. Stewart?(18--1)
You don't know me.(18--1)
I can't expect you to take my side against Boswell.(18--1)
But I do need some publicity(18--1)
so that the people of our town(18--1)
know that I'm running for office(18--1)
and that I care about our children.(18--1)
Fair enough.(18--1)
I certainly can print the news.(18--1)
And you are now making news.(18--1)
Here are the fliers, hot off the press!(18--2)
Looks good.(18--2)
Simple.(18--2)
Right over here, Grandpa.(18--2)
You fold the fliers.(18--2)
Richard and I will put them into the envelopes.(18--2)
We finished addressing over three hundred envelopes.(18--2)
Need another box?(18--2)
Good work, gang.(18--2)
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.(18--2)
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Anderson?(18--2)
Mr. Nelson.(18--2)
Hi. This is Robbie Stewart.(18--2)
Did you know(18--2)
my mother is running for the school board?(18--2)
Yes, Miss Kim, Ellen Stewart.(18--2)
"She cares."(18--2)
Oh, see you at the polls.(18--2)
Certainly.(18--2)
I'll give her your best wishes,(18--2)
Mr. Nelson.(18--2)
Hi, this is Mike Johnson.(18--2)
Can I speak with Mr. or Mrs. Burns?(18--2)
Thank you.(18--2)
We have done so much(18--2)
in such a short amount of time.(18--2)
I can't believe it!(18--2)
Wait till Philip comes home and sees our progress.(18--2)
Everyone saw the story in the Riverdale newspaper.(18--2)
Mr. Maxwell was very kind(18--2)
to print my announcement.(18--2)
It helps enormously.(18--2)
Everybody in Riverdale reads his paper.(18--2)
Your photo in it helped, too.(18--2)
Thanks to you, Richard,(18--2)
it's a good picture.(18--2)
Well, hi, all.(18--2)
Hi, Dad.(18--2)
Hello, darling.(18--2)
May I...may I help?(18--2)
Licking envelopes.(18--2)
I fold the fliers.(18--2)
We stuff them.(18--2)
And I lick the envelopes.(18--2)
Hey, everybody,(18--2)
Mrs. Greenberg is on the phone.(18--2)
She says Carter Boswell is on the TV right now--(18--2)
doing a commercial.(18--2)
What channel?(18--2)
-Five.(18--2)
-five?(18--2)
...and if you ask what I care about,I'll tell you.(18--2)
I care about the school buildings in need of paint.(18--2)
I care about more lockers for the teachers.(18--2)
I care about new fixtures in the hallways--(18--2)
not music or dancing or entertainment.(18--2)
I care about the practical things.(18--2)
If you do, vote for me, Carter Boswell.(18--2)
A lot of people will agree with him.(18--2)
I told you.(18--2)
Too bad kids can't vote.(18--2)
It's our school, but we can't vote.(18--2)
There are people in favor of the cultural programs,Mom.(18--2)
There are, Ellen.(18--2)
Don't be upset by Boswell's commercial.(18--2)
You have to go on television,too.(18--2)
Boswell's a powerful speaker.(18--2)
You can be, too.(18--2)
Your ideas are good ones.(18--2)
I don't know.(18--2)
I'm not sure I'm up to it.(18--2)
...my slogan is "I care."(18--3)
I care about people, not things.(18--3)
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.(18--3)
I care.(18--3)
How was it?(18--3)
You were terrific!(18--3)
Can I see it?(18--3)
Sure.(18--3)
Hello. My name is Ellen Stewart,(18--3)
and I'm running for the open seat on the school board.(18--3)
My slogan is "I care."(18--3)
What does the word care mean?(18--3)
...I care about people,not things.(18--3)
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.(18--3)
I care.(18--3)
I like it,(18--3)
but now what?(18--3)
How can we possibly get it on so Riverdale(18--3)
will see it and hear it?(18--3)
Leave it to me.(18--3)
...I mean that when I say "I care",(18--3)
I care about people, not things.(18--3)
Vote for me, Ellen Stewart.(18--3)
I care.(18--3)
What happened?(18--3)
Mom is now on television(18--3)
in every appliance store in Riverdale,(18--3)
except Hamlin's.(18--3)
He's a Boswell voter.(18--3)
That's a brilliant idea, Richard!(18--3)
You inherited your father's brains.(18--3)
We got our brains from you, Dad.(18--3)
And guess what?(18--3)
I called channel five.(18--3)
Their TV news is going to cover it.(18--3)
"Housewife campaigns in appliance stores."(18--3)
And I'll bet(18--3)
some magazine will pick up the story, too.(18--3)
Mom, you're going to win!(18--3)
I know it!(18--3)
Hold it, Robbie!(18--3)
Just cool down.(18--3)
I know we're getting some attention now,(18--3)
but in the end the voters will have to decide.(18--3)
You're gonna win.(18--3)
Trust me!(18--3)
In the hotly contested race(18--3)
for the one seat on the Riverdale School Board,(18--3)
Mrs. Ellen Stewart has taken an early lead.(18--3)
She's winning!(18--3)
-Mom, you're winning!(18--3)
-Now returning to other local news...(18--3)
Riverdale High School(18--3)
-beat its rival Horace Mann in baseball today.(18--3)
-It's too soon to know for certain.(18--3)
You're ahead.(18--3)
That's better than being behind.(18--3)
More sports after this.(18--3)
It's not over yet.(18--3)
Let's just all calm down,(18--3)
and wait for the final results.(18--3)
Ellen,why don't you go out to the backyard(18--3)
and get some fresh air?(18--3)
Thank you, Grandpa.(18--3)
I need some.(18--3)
What happened?(18--3)
You came very close, Ellen.(18--3)
You lost by only a hundred and twenty-one votes. (18--3)
I lost.(18--3)
You tried, Mom.(18--3)
You lost by a very small number of votes.(18--3)
Only one hundred and twenty-one votes!(18--3)
I'm sorry, Mom.(18--3)
There just wasn't enough time.(18--3)
Look,(18--3)
you've made a very strong impression(18--3)
on our community.(18--3)
You'll have another chance next election.(18--3)
Hello.(18--3)
Oh, yes, yes, Mr. Maxwell.(18--3)
Hello,Mr. Maxwell.(18--3)
How are you?(18--3)
I just called to tell you that you are very impressive.(18--3)
You lost the election,(18--3)
but you won the attention of the residents of Riverdale,(18--3)
of Boswell, and of me.(18--3)
Well, thank you, Mr. Maxwell.(18--3)
I appreciate your kind words.(18--3)
I needed that.(18--3)
I hear Boswell(18--3)
wants to appoint you to a special arts committee.(18--3)
I'm sending over a reporter(18--3)
in the morning to interview you.(18--3)
You are?(18--3)
I'm gonna do an article(18--3)
on "Ellen Stewart--she cares."(18--3)
Maybe we'll all care now.(18--3)
Good-bye.(18--3)
Thank you--(18--3)
and good-bye.(18--3)
What was that about?(18--3)
You were right, Philip.(18--3)
I did make a difference in town.(18--3)
And in this family.(18--3)
It looks wrong.(19--1)
Hmmm. It is wrong.(19--1)
Are they always that difficult to make?(19--1)
The truth is...yes.(19--1)
I'll try again.(19--1)
At this rate,the wedding will take place tomorrow.(19--1)
Not to worry.(19--1)
OK. Here we go.(19--1)
I'm worried, Philip.(19--1)
What if we can't tie the tie?(19--1)
If we can't tie the tie,(19--1)
then there can't be a wedding.(19--1)
You'd better not make Harry(19--1)
any more nervous than he is.(19--1)
Don't worry.(19--1)
We'll figure a way.(19--1)
How're you doing,fellas?(19--1)
Not so good, Grandpa.(19--1)
We can't get this bow tie tied.(19--1)
Nobody knows how to do it.(19--1)
Do you?(19--1)
No.I never could,either.(19--1)
Well, you have your own tuxedo.(19--1)
How do you tie your bow tie?(19--1)
Yeah, Grandpa,(19--1)
I've seen you in it.(19--1)
You look great.(19--1)
How do you tie it?(19--1)
-I don't.(19--1)
-You don't?(19--1)
What do you mean?(19--1)
I never could tie one of those...(19--1)
things...bow ties.(19--1)
I have always worn a clip-on bow tie.(19--1)
A clip-on?(19--1)
Of course.(19--1)
Now I remember.(19--1)
Yes, it's so easy.(19--1)
All you do is(19--1)
clip it around under your collar.(19--1)
We all need one of those.(19--1)
The tuxedo rental store.(19--1)
Do you think they're open?(19--1)
Should be.(19--1)
Sunday's their big day.(19--1)
I'll call and find out.(19--1)
Well, if they're not,(19--1)
I'll lend you mine, Harry.(19--1)
You're the only one(19--1)
who really needs to be wearing a tuxedo,anyway.(19--1)
Thanks, Grandpa.(19--1)
I'm the father of the bride.(19--1)
I'm supposed to be worried about my daughter,(19--1)
and here I am with(19--1)
the man that's marrying my daughter--(19--1)
worrying about him.(19--1)
Poor Harry.(19--1)
I know the feeling.(19--1)
Wedding-day Jitters.(19--1)
Are they open?(19--1)
We're in luck.(19--1)
They're open.(19--1)
And they have lots of clip-on bow ties.(19--1)
I'll bicycle down to the village and get them.(19--1)
You'd better hurry, Robbie.(19--1)
There's lots of time.(19--1)
A little over two hours.(19--1)
In two hours and fifteen minutes(19--1)
I'll be married to Susan.(19--1)
And be a true member of the Stewart family.(19--1)
Oh, you're a lucky guy, Harry.(19--1)
Susan is one of the best women you'll ever find.(19--1)
She's just like her grandma.(19--1)
Now, once you put the ring on Susan's finger,(19--1)
you are one of us, Harry.(19--1)
And don't ever forget it.(19--1)
Ring? Ring?(19--1)
Oh my!(19--1)
What did I do with the rings?(19--1)
I put them in the pocket of my sports jacket.(19--1)
No,(19--1)
I think you put them(19--1)
in your tuxedo jacket pocket.(19--1)
Remember?(19--1)
Right.(19--1)
What did I do with the rings?(19--1)
Didn't you give them to Richard?(19--1)
He's your best man.(19--1)
I remember.(19--1)
You gave them to Richard.(19--1)
Oh, yeah.(19--1)
I remember now.(19--1)
You handed them to me.(19--1)
What did I do with them?(19--1)
I hope they aren't lost.(19--1)
Oh, don't worry, Harry.(19--1)
They have to be here.(19--1)
I remember.(19--1)
I gave them to Robbie to hold(19--1)
so I wouldn't lose them.(19--1)
Where's Robbie?(19--1)
Relax, Harry.(19--1)
Robbie went to pick up(19--1)
the clip-on bow ties.(19--1)
Oh, I forgot.(19--1)
What time is it?(19--1)
It's still a little over two hours,Harry.(19--1)
Just relax.(19--1)
What about the rings?(19--1)
I'm sure Robbie has them.(19--1)
No, no, Robbie doesn't have them.(19--1)
He gave them to me to hold on to them(19--1)
because he didn't want the responsibility of holding them.(19--1)
I put them in my tuxedo--(19--1)
but in the lapel pocket.(19--1)
That's a relief.(19--1)
I was really worried.(19--1)
I'll hold on to them for you.(19--1)
The best man always keeps the rings.(19--1)
You're right.(19--1)
You hold on to them so there won't be a problem later.(19--1)
Well,(19--1)
now,I think we'd better get dressed,fellas.(19--1)
All right!(19--1)
Robbie will bring the ties back.(19--1)
Hey, leaving me?(19--1)
You'll be fine.(19--1)
Try to take it easy.(19--1)
It'll all be over in two hours.(19--1)
Over?(19--1)
The wedding ceremony will be over.(19--1)
You'll be husband and wife.(19--1)
I guess you're right.(19--1)
Two hours from now.(19--1)
Hm, two hours from now.(19--1)
And now for...something old,(19--2)
something new, something borrowed,(19--2)
and something blue.(19--2)
OK. Let's see.(19--2)
Something borrowed.(19--2)
That's this dress.Borrowed from Marilyn.(19--2)
Something blue.(19--2)
My wristband.(19--2)
I wore it when I married your father.(19--2)
Oh,Mother.I forgot you still had it.(19--2)
It's just so lovely.(19--2)
I bought it in an antique shop(19--2)
when I was about eighteen years old.(19--2)
I saved it for my wedding day.(19--2)
And you saved it for me, didn't you, Mother?(19--2)
Yes, honey. I did.(19--2)
Are we ever going to finish?(19--2)
All right.OK.(19--2)
Something borrowed.(19--2)
The wedding dress.And something blue.(19--2)
The wristband.Something old?(19--2)
Something old.(19--2)
Right. What's old?(19--2)
Of course!(19--2)
Something old.(19--2)
I had planned to wear them.(19--2)
Grandma's pearls!(19--2)
Oh, Grandpa will be so pleased that you're wearing them.(19--2)
I'm sure he misses Grandma on a day like this.(19--2)
Help me with them, Marilyn.(19--2)
I've never worn them before.(19--2)
I've been saving them for today.(19--2)
Saving them for today?(19--2)
Oh, you're a real Stewart!(19--2)
Oh, there you go.(19--2)
Lovely!(19--2)
Lovely!(19--2)
Lovely!(19--2)
Something borrowed, something blue.(19--2)
Something old...(19--2)
and now for something new.(19--2)
The veil.(19--2)
Oh, it's so beautiful, Marilyn!(19--2)
You really are a fabulous designer, Marilyn.(19--2)
Doesn't it look just right on Susan?(19--2)
Perfect!(19--2)
And when you both say,"I do,"(19--2)
Harry will lift this veil over your head(19--2)
and kiss the bride.(19--2)
Oh, I'm so excited!(19--2)
When you said, "I do," Marilyn,(19--2)
it suddenly became real.(19--2)
That's all right, Susan.(19--2)
You've got the wedding-day jitters!(19--2)
In less than two hours,(19--2)
you will be Mrs. Harry Bennett.(19--2)
Oh, that reminds me.(19--2)
If we don't get dressed,(19--2)
we won't be there(19--2)
to see Susan become Mrs. Harry Bennett.(19--2)
Before you leave--do I look all right?(19--2)
You never looked better.(19--2)
Mom.(19--2)
She's right.(19--2)
And that's dear little Max.(19--2)
Got to go and feed him.(19--2)
What am I supposed to do?(19--2)
Take off the veil,(19--2)
kick off your shoes, and sit down.(19--2)
We'll come upstairs and get you in a little while.(19--2)
Richard's going to take some wedding pictures(19--2)
before the ceremony.(19--2)
So just relax.(19--2)
Are you kidding? Relax?(19--2)
Susan Stewart ...(19--2)
you are about to become Susan Bennett--(19--2)
Mrs. Harry Bennett.(19--2)
Ah, Judge.(19--3)
-How are you?(19--3)
-How are you?(19--3)
-Hello.(19--3)
I think it's time for the wedding to begin.(19--3)
All right,ladies and gentlemen.(19--3)
Please take your places.(19--3)
The wedding ceremony is about to begin.(19--3)
OK, Jane. Start the music.(19--3)
Dearly beloved,(19--3)
we are gathered here today(19--3)
to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.(19--3)
Do either of you have any reason(19--3)
why you should not be legally joined in marriage?(19--3)
Is there anyone present who can show(19--3)
any just cause why these two people(19--3)
should not be legally joined in marriage?(19--3)
Then,Harry Bennett, do you take Susan Stewart(19--3)
to be your lawful, wedded wife?(19--3)
I do.(19--3)
And you, Susan Stewart,(19--3)
do you take Harry Bennett(19--3)
to be your lawful, wedded husband?(19--3)
I do.(19--3)
The rings, please.(19--3)
I have them, Harry.(19--3)
By the power vested in me by the laws of the State of New York,(19--3)
I now pronounce you husband and wife.(19--3)
You may kiss the bride now, Harry.(19--3)
Where's Mom?(20--1)
She went to a school-board meeting.(20--1)
I don't know how she does it.(20--1)
She sure keeps busy.(20--1)
It's important to her.(20--1)
There are lots of places to go,(20--1)
lots of things to do.(20--1)
She can't sit around and do nothing.(20--1)
Philip works late.(20--1)
I guess you're right.(20--1)
I wish I had her energy.(20--1)
Anybody home?(20--1)
We're in here, Dad.(20--1)
Oh.Hi,gang.(20--1)
Hello, Philip.(20--1)
How was your day?(20--1)
My day was just fine.(20--1)
So was my night.(20--1)
It's almost ten o'clock.(20--1)
Mmm. I'm starving.(20--1)
Um ... where's Mom?(20--1)
She went to a school-board meeting.(20--1)
There's a note for you on the refrigerator.(20--1)
Oh?(20--1)
Did you have dinner, Robbie?(20--1)
Yeah.(20--1)
Mike and I had a hamburger at the diner.(20--1)
I came home a little while ago.(20--1)
You've been working late(20--1)
almost every night this week, Dad.(20--1)
Aren't you exhausted?(20--1)
I don't have time to be exhausted.(20--1)
You and Mom haven't had dinner together with us(20--1)
in almost a full week.(20--1)
Yeah,(20--1)
I feel bad(20--1)
about us not having dinner with the family,(20--1)
but our schedules are so different.(20--1)
Either I'm at the hospital doing paperwork,(20--1)
or Mom is at a committee meeting.(20--1)
I frankly don't know what to do about it.(20--1)
I'm worried about you and Mom.(20--1)
You really have been working too hard.(20--1)
Well,(20--1)
I think I've had enough of that sandwich.(20--1)
You didn't finish it.(20--1)
It's not good to eat before going to bed.(20--1)
A cookie can't hurt, though.(20--1)
Well,(20--1)
I'm heading off for bed(20--1)
and a good night's sleep.(20--1)
Well, good night.(20--1)
Good night, Son.(20--1)
Good night, Dad.(20--1)
I'm going to bed.(20--1)
Good night, Philip.(20--1)
Haven't you finished balancing that checkbook?(20--1)
I found another mistake.(20--1)
I'll be off to bed myself in a minute.(20--1)
OK. Good night.(20--1)
I'm really concerned about them,(20--1)
Grandpa.(20--1)
Concerned about whom?(20--1)
About Mom and Dad.(20--1)
They hardly ever see each other.(20--1)
Dad often works late,(20--1)
and Mom has all these committees she's on.(20--1)
What do you propose to do about it?(20--1)
You have that look in your eye.(20--1)
I don't know,(20--1)
but there must be a way(20--1)
of getting them to spend more time together.(20--1)
Quality time.(20--1)
Hello there, Robbie.(20--2)
What are you doing up this late?(20--2)
Reading.(20--2)
Reading?(20--2)
At this hour?(20--2)
Ah, come on, Robbie.(20--2)
What are you doing up this late?(20--2)
Things on my mind.(20--2)
Do you care to talk about them?(20--2)
Sure,(20--2)
if you don't mind listening.(20--2)
Robbie, Robbie, remember me?(20--2)
I'm your mother.(20--2)
If you have something you want to talk about,(20--2)
I'm always prepared to listen.(20--2)
You haven't been around much lately.(20--2)
So that's it.(20--2)
OK, let's talk.(20--2)
You and Dad are like ships that pass in the night.(20--2)
Dad works hard, and he works late.(20--2)
You work hard on all your committees,(20--2)
and you work late.(20--2)
I thought you were proud of the work I do.(20--2)
I am, Mom.(20--2)
Real proud.(20--2)
You are one fantastic mom,(20--2)
but...but I've been noticing(20--2)
how little quality time(20--2)
you spend with Dad and me ... and the family.(20--2)
It's a real problem, Robbie.(20--2)
I know it.(20--2)
I'm concerned.(20--2)
There must be a way(20--2)
that Dad and you can spend more time together.(20--2)
Well, we always talk about(20--2)
taking a vacation together--with the family.(20--2)
I think you ought to(20--2)
take a vacation away from the family--alone.(20--2)
Kind of a second honeymoon.(20--2)
It would be wonderful,(20--2)
but our schedules won't allow it.(20--2)
I think I have an idea.(20--2)
You do?(20--2)
Yup.(20--2)
I think I have an idea(20--2)
that will bring Dad and you(20--2)
together in a more scheduled way.(20--2)
What is it?(20--2)
Well,(20--2)
you know how Dad is always talking about(20--2)
the kids in the ward(20--2)
and how important it is for them to be paid attention to?(20--2)
Yes.(20--2)
Well...(20--2)
and how hard it is(20--2)
because the doctors and nurses are so busy!(20--2)
Yes.(20--2)
Well, how would it be if you took some time(20--2)
to work with Dad towards solving that problem?(20--2)
I don't get it.(20--2)
Like setting up a regular weekly reading program.(20--2)
You and Dad.(20--2)
You and Dr. Philip Stewart--(20--2)
going to the children's ward once or twice a week(20--2)
and reading to them.(20--2)
Not bad.(20--2)
Not a bad idea, Robbie.(20--2)
As a matter of fact,(20--2)
it fits right in with something I'm working on right now(20--2)
with the school-board committee.(20--2)
What's that?(20--2)
I've been trying(20--2)
to work out a program(20--2)
in the public school(20--2)
that will bring parents and teachers together once a week(20--2)
to read to the students--their own children,really.(20--2)
By doing that, it will encourage reading.(20--2)
So it might fit in with a program(20--2)
for reading to the kids in the hospital.(20--2)
You're right.(20--2)
We'll do it!(20--2)
I'm going to talk to Daddy about it right now.(20--2)
But Dad was so exhausted when he came home from work.(20--2)
Why don't you talk to him about it tomorrow?(20--2)
You are a very smart young man, Robbie.(20--2)
I think I'll wait until tomorrow.(20--2)
You won't forget, will you?(20--2)
Believe me, I won't.(20--2)
It is a great idea,(20--2)
and I promise you I won't forget.(20--2)
Thanks, Mom.(20--2)
Thank you, Robbie.(20--2)
Good morning.(20--3)
What a wonderful morning!(20--3)
Don't the flowers smell wonderful?(20--3)
Good morning, Ellen.(20--3)
Yes, they do.(20--3)
That's why I'm reading my paper and having my coffee(20--3)
on the patio this morning.(20--3)
Ah, it does smell sweet.(20--3)
How was your school-board meeting last night?(20--3)
You must've come home very late.(20--3)
Did you find the sandwich I made for you?(20--3)
Thanks, dear.(20--3)
I was so tired(20--3)
I didn't even finish it.(20--3)
Philip, I've been working on this special project(20--3)
with the school board,(20--3)
and I'd like your opinion about it.(20--3)
What is it?(20--3)
I've been trying to find(20--3)
a way to encourage reading.(20--3)
Good luck!(20--3)
Well, I think I may have found a way to do it.(20--3)
Tell me about it.(20--3)
I work with families every day, Ellen.(20--3)
I see how people spend their leisure time--(20--3)
young and old.(20--3)
Mostly watching television.(20--3)
Well, that would be OK(20--3)
if, and I repeat,(20--3)
if people took the time to read.(20--3)
I couldn't agree with you more.(20--3)
The question is,(20--3)
how do we get them to read more?(20--3)
I think(20--3)
you're going to give me the answer to that question.(20--3)
You have that look in your eye.(20--3)
I do have an answer, Philip.(20--3)
Or at least I think I do.(20--3)
Well, tell me about it.(20--3)
The plan is a simple one.(20--3)
Involve the entire family in a reading project.(20--3)
In the home?(20--3)
Yes, in the home.(20--3)
But first in the school-rooms.(20--3)
Hmm, interesting.(20--3)
But how do you plan to do that?(20--3)
By arranging with the public schools(20--3)
to schedule one hour a week--to start with.(20--3)
During that time(20--3)
parents are invited to attend--(20--3)
and to read along with the children--their children.(20--3)
It can go beyond the school system,Ellen.(20--3)
Really?(20--3)
I guarantee you it would go very well in the hospitals.(20--3)
My patients--mostly kids--(20--3)
would love to read and be read to.(20--3)
You think so?(20--3)
I know so.(20--3)
Maybe we can experiment with your patients(20--3)
and see how the plan works.(20--3)
I love the idea.(20--3)
Would you work with me on it?(20--3)
I would love to, Philip.(20--3)
And that way,(20--3)
we'll spend more time together,Ellen.(20--3)
We just don't see each other anymore.(20--3)
You and I are very busy these days.(20--3)
This is true.(20--3)
We need to find time to be together more,(20--3)
to do things together more--you and I.(20--3)
This would be a wonderful way to accomplish that.(20--3)
I have a question.(20--3)
Yes?(20--3)
What do we read?(20--3)
To the patients in the ward?(20--3)
Yes.(20--3)
Well,(20--3)
let you and I talk about it.(20--3)
What would you like to read to them?(20--3)
Mrs. Stewart and I(20--3)
will read a poem by Robert Frost.(20--3)
It's called(20--3)
Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.(20--3)
Would you begin, Ellen?(20--3)
All right.(20--3)
"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening"(20--3)
by Robert Frost.(20--3)
Whose woods these are I think I know.(20--3)
His house is in the village though;(20--3)
He will not see me stopping here(20--3)
To watch his woods fill up with snow.(20--3)
My little horse must think it queer(20--3)
To stop without a farmhouse near(20--3)
Between the woods and frozen lake(20--3)
The darkest evening of the year.(20--3)
He gives his harness bells a shake(20--3)
To ask if there is some mistake.(20--3)
The only other sound's the sweep of easy wind and downy flake.(20--3)
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,(20--3)
But I have promises to keep,(20--3)
And miles to go before I sleep,(20--3)
And miles to go before I sleep.(20--3)
You two belong on stage! That was wonderful!(20--3)
Grandpa!(20--3)
Dad ... Robbie. When did you come?(20--3)
We've been listening to you both.(20--3)
These are lucky kids.(20--3)
Do you enjoy reading together?(20--3)
Well, we may read together aloud at home.(20--3)
You were right, Robbie.(20--3)
I know.(20--3)
I really like this one Susan. Do you?(21--1)
Turn around,Michelle.Let me see the back of it.(21--1)
I like it a lot. It fits well.(21--1)
It doesn't need any alterations.We must've bought the right size.(21--1)
I like the color. She looks good in blue.(21--1)
I like blue, too, Daddy.(21--1)
Try on the skirt and blouse outfit,Michelle--(21--1)
the one that Daddy wanted you to wear.(21--1)
OK.(21--1)
Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married.(21--1)
She's never been happier.(21--1)
And I've never been happier,Harry.(21--1)
I love her very much. She's been a joy.(21--1)
We're very lucky, the three of us...(21--1)
and becoming part of the Stewart family,too.(21--1)
We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?(21--1)
Well...(21--1)
Well...?Could we ask for anything more?(21--1)
Well...we...(21--1)
How do you like it, Daddy?(21--1)
It's my favorite outfit.(21--1)
It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.(21--1)
I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this.(21--1)
Do you want to see the winter jacket on me,Susan?(21--1)
Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans,(21--1)
and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.(21--1)
OK.(21--1)
What did you mean by "well ...?"(21--1)
You had something on your mind(21--1)
when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.(21--1)
Is everything all right?(21--1)
Everything is fine,Michelle.(21--1)
Let's take a look at the winter jacket.Come on over here,honey.(21--1)
It's kind of warm.(21--1)
It is. That's why we bought it for you.(21--1)
This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime(21--1)
when it's very cold out.(21--1)
But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong size.(21--1)
Looks like we should've bought a bigger one.(21--1)
I guess we'll have to exchange it,too.(21--1)
I'm sure the store has others.(21--1)
I look silly!It is too small!(21--1)
You're growing so fast, Michelle.(21--1)
Can I take it off? I'm hot!(21--1)
Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.(21--1)
Well,are you going to tell me what's on your mind, Harry?(21--1)
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company(21--1)
in Los Angeles.(21--1)
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company(21--1)
in Los Angeles.(21--1)
Los Angeles? That's a big decision.(21--1)
I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.(21--1)
Wow!It sure will.But first tell me about the job, Harry.(21--1)
If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.(21--1)
I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue.(21--1)
I do his taxes every year.(21--1)
He has a big sales office in Los Angeles,(21--1)
and the company in Los Angeles(21--1)
that does his major accounting work(21--1)
is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.(21--1)
That's wonderful, Harry.(21--1)
Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.(21--1)
What about the salary?(21--1)
The real discussion comes tomorrow.(21--1)
Susan, I don't plan to make any decisions Susan(21--1)
until I have a chance to talk with you about it.(21--1)
I understand, Harry.(21--1)
And I don't have to make a quick decision.(21--1)
They know that I'm married and that I have a family.(21--1)
Well, there's a lot to think about.(21--1)
If it's a good job,(21--1)
then I've got to do some thinking about(21--1)
my career opportunities in Los Angeles.(21--1)
Is everything OK?(21--1)
Yes, honey.(21--1)
(21--1)
(21--1)
(21--1)
Hello. Hello there.(21--2)
Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?(21--2)
Oh!Hi,Grandpa.Yes,of course,I am,but my mind isn't.(21--2)
What's the matter, Susan?(21--2)
A real dilemma.(21--2)
Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?(21--2)
Yes,but I don't know where to start.(21--2)
Maybe I can help.Tell me what it is,Susan.(21--2)
Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down.(21--2)
Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
Well, this is something to think about.(21--2)
There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle.(21--2)
I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job.(21--2)
I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
And what about our family?(21--2)
Can I tell you what I think?(21--2)
Tell me.(21--2)
I think that you're very successful(21--2)
and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry.(21--2)
I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta,(21--2)
and I think(21--2)
he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
He was very helpful to me, remember?(21--2)
I suppose I could call him.(21--2)
But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York,(21--2)
you, and the rest of our family.(21--2)
Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan.(21--2)
You know we'd all miss you.(21--2)
But this should be your decision.(21--2)
It's something that only you and Harry can work out.(21--2)
If moving to L.A. is in Harry's best interest,(21--2)
I have to do what I can do to support him.(21--2)
In every marriage,(21--2)
sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.(21--2)
And what about Michelle?(21--2)
Well, what do you think?(21--2)
I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.(21--2)
What does she think?(21--2)
I don't know for sure.(21--2)
Well, you'll have to ask her.(21--2)
I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta(21--2)
and get his feelings about my leaving.(21--2)
And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
Good idea.(21--2)
I'll call him right now. No point in delaying.(21--2)
Thanks, Grandpa.(21--2)
Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.(21--2)
It's a big decision for me, Bill.(21--2)
And I have to discuss it with my wife.(21--2)
I don't know if it's right for her.(21--2)
She'll love it.It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer,Harry.(21--2)
OK. Tell it to me again.(21--2)
The company is Craft and Craft,(21--2)
the biggest accounting company in the country.(21--2)
I know the company well. It's big.(21--2)
The biggest.(21--2)
Yeah,yeah.The biggest.When do I have to let you know?(21--2)
Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.(21--2)
When would we have to move?(21--2)
As soon as possible.(21--2)
I also have my daughter to consider.(21--2)
I don't want to interrupt her school year.(21--2)
Let me know by the end of the week.(21--2)
It's a great opportunity for you, Harry.(21--2)
Believe me.(21--2)
I know.(21--2)
Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.(21--2)
Yeah, I know. The biggest.(21--2)
I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.(21--2)
I met with Bill York today.(21--2)
And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?(21--2)
Yup. He asked me if I want the job.(21--2)
That's exciting, Harry. What was it?(21--2)
A vice-presidency(21--2)
with the biggest accounting company in the country-(21--2)
Craft and Craft.(21--2)
Aren't you excited about that?(21--2)
Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.(21--2)
I talked to Mr. Marchetta.(21--2)
What did he say? Did you tell him about me?(21--2)
Of course,Harry.I want what's best for you,(21--2)
and I think I can get a good job(21--2)
through Mr. Marchetta(21--2)
in Los Angeles also.(21--2)
You're kidding.(21--2)
No, I'm not kidding.(21--2)
I talked with him, and he understands completely.(21--2)
He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles,(21--2)
and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.(21--2)
Unbelievable!(21--2)
But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.(21--2)
You're right. We'll talk to her about it.(21--2)
And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?(21--2)
How should I feel?(21--2)
It's the biggest company in the country.(21--2)
Well,then you feel good about taking it?(21--2)
Well ... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?(21--2)
I love my school. I have so many good friends there now.(21--3)
I wouldn't miss a day even if I were really sick.(21--3)
Come and sit down for a minute,Michelle.(21--3)
I'd like to talk to you about something.(21--3)
Something important.(21--3)
What's wrong, Susan?(21--3)
Oh, there's nothing wrong, Michelle.(21--3)
But your daddy and I are talking about something(21--3)
that I'd like your opinion about.(21--3)
I know. I heard you talking about it(21--3)
the other night when I was trying on my new clothes.(21--3)
It's about moving to Los Angeles.(21--3)
You're right. How do you feel about it?(21--3)
Well, I really wouldn't want to move, but...(21--3)
But?(21--3)
But if you and Daddy wanted to,(21--3)
I guess you know what's best for the family and for me.(21--3)
That's very considerate of you,Michelle.(21--3)
But what about your friends?(21--3)
I'd miss them a lot,(21--3)
but I know what it feels like to miss someone.(21--3)
Honey, we don't have to move(21--3)
if you're not going to be happy about it.(21--3)
Does Daddy want to move?(21--3)
I think so. He's going to tell us tonight about the job offer.(21--3)
Well, how was everybody's day today?(21--3)
Michelle was chosen to do(21--3)
the school poster for the play this year.(21--3)
Congratulations, Michelle! That's something!(21--3)
And how was your day, Susan?(21--3)
I see you're in a good mood.(21--3)
Why don't you tell us about your day.(21--3)
I met with Bill York.(21--3)
It's OK to talk about it, Harry.(21--3)
Michelle knows all about it.(21--3)
Really?(21--3)
Really, Harry.(21--3)
Michelle and I have all kinds of feelings(21--3)
about leaving New York, the family, and friends.(21--3)
But if you think you should take the job, we're behind you.(21--3)
What about Michelle's school?(21--3)
We'll move after the school term.(21--3)
What about her new friends?(21--3)
I'll make new friends wherever we are as long as we're together.(21--3)
We're a family, Harry.(21--3)
Whatever you think is right for you is right for us.(21--3)
I am so touched. The two of you are really something.(21--3)
We love you, Daddy.(21--3)
And I love you.(21--3)
OK. Now, tell us about your talk with Mr. York.(21--3)
Did you take the job?(21--3)
Nope.(21--3)
What?(21--3)
No? You didn't take it?(21--3)
No, I did not take the job.(21--3)
But, Daddy, I thought...(21--3)
Harry, you didn't turn it down because of me?(21--3)
Or me?(21--3)
No, no. I turned it down because of me.(21--3)
How's that?(21--3)
Well, I began to think about you and about Michelle,(21--3)
and then I asked myself,(21--3)
do I really want to work for the biggest company in the country?(21--3)
And?(21--3)
And I don't.(21--3)
I went into business for myself(21--3)
because I like being my own boss.(21--3)
I run my own company. I'm a big fish in a little pond.(21--3)
I'm not really sure I want to be a little fish in a big pond.(21--3)
Oh, Daddy, does that mean we don't have to move?(21--3)
That's right, sweetheart.(21--3)
Are you sure?(21--3)
I couldn't be more sure, Susan.(21--3)
I'm glad if you are, Harry.(21--3)
And besides,(21--3)
how could I live in Los Angeles(21--3)
when all my favorite people live here?(21--3)
Your favorite people?(21--3)
Who's that?(21--3)
The Stewart family, of course.(21--3)
"Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top,(22--1)
When the wind blows,(22--1)
The cradle will rock.(22--1)
When the bough breaks,(22--1)
The cradle will fall,(22--1)
And down will come baby,(22--1)
Cradle and all."(22--1)
Hi,Marilyn,(22--1)
What are you doing?(22--1)
Just sketching.(22--1)
I've been thinking a lot about our responsibilities(22--1)
in the past few weeks.(22--1)
I never stop thinking about them.(22--1)
I've been wrestling(22--1)
with the question of whether I go back to work or not.(22--1)
I see.(22--1)
And I'm torn.(22--1)
I really want to go back to work,(22--1)
use my talents,(22--1)
and pursue my career in fashion design(22--1)
like we always thought I would.(22--1)
But now ...(22--1)
I want to be with Max as a full-time mother,(22--1)
especially when he's a baby.(22--1)
I really understand, Marilyn.(22--1)
But you never have to worry about Max.(22--1)
There's Mother and Grandpa ...(22--1)
and I can always arrange my photo schedule(22--1)
around your schedule,(22--1)
if that will help.(22--1)
It's not the same, Richard.(22--1)
Have you discussed going back to work with your boss?(22--1)
Rita Mae called yesterday.(22--1)
Ah! That's what's got you thinking, isn't it?(22--1)
She wants to know(22--1)
when I think I'll be returning to the boutique.(22--1)
And you said...?(22--1)
I said I'd give her an answer in a few days...(22--1)
that I wasn't sure.(22--1)
I'm sure Rita Mae will understand(22--1)
and wait until you're ready to go back to work.(22--1)
Well, maybe she will, and maybe she won't.(22--1)
Who knows?(22--1)
If I don't accept her offer,(22--1)
maybe she'll find someone else in the meantime,(22--1)
and when I'm ready to go back,(22--1)
there won't be a job for me.(22--1)
That's something to consider.(22--1)
You've got yourself to think about, too.(22--1)
But I am thinking about myself.(22--1)
Don't you see?(22--1)
What do you mean?(22--1)
It's not just the job.(22--1)
It's also my career as Max's mother.(22--1)
That's the way I look at it.(22--1)
I have two career opportunities at the same time.(22--1)
My career as a fashion designer(22--1)
and my career as a mother.(22--1)
I never really thought about being a mother as a career.(22--1)
I guess you do have two career opportunities(22--1)
and a decision to make.(22--1)
I hear Max.(22--1)
-I'll go to him.(22--1)
-No,That's OK.I'll do it.(22--1)
There's your teddy bear, Max.(22--2)
He just loves that teddy bear(22--2)
that Grandpa Philip bought for him.(22--2)
I took him to Philip's office yesterday for a checkup.(22--2)
You should have seen the look on his face(22--2)
when Molly gave him the injection.(22--2)
Oh, did he cry?(22--2)
No.(22--2)
My dear little boy just looked up at me as if to say,(22--2)
"Mama, what are they doing to me? Help!"(22--2)
How did you feel?(22--2)
Tell the truth.(22--2)
Didn't you feel terrible?(22--2)
I sure did.(22--2)
I held him closely.(22--2)
I kissed the top of his dear little head.(22--2)
He looked up at me.(22--2)
He tried to smile.(22--2)
Being with him helped.(22--2)
Helped him?(22--2)
Or helped you?(22--2)
Being a mother is not easy,(22--2)
if that's what you mean.(22--2)
Speaking of being a mother,(22--2)
I've been meaning to ask you(22--2)
what you were thinking about regarding going back to work.(22--2)
I know Rita Mae called.(22--2)
I can imagine what is going through your head.(22--2)
I'm sure you can, Ellen.(22--2)
There are so many things to consider.(22--2)
One thing that makes it easier for you(22--2)
is that you have us.(22--2)
Max will always have a family member to watch over him(22--2)
while you're at work.(22--2)
I didn't have that when Richard and Susan were born.(22--2)
What did you do?(22--2)
I chose to continue with my career as a music teacher.(22--2)
We hired a woman to watch Richard and then Susan,(22--2)
and I continued with my career.(22--2)
Do you think you made the right decision?(22--2)
I think I did.(22--2)
But when Robbie was born,(22--2)
I decided to give full-time attention to raising Robbie.(22--2)
I felt differently at that time.(22--2)
And you gave up your career as a music teacher?(22--2)
Not exactly.(22--2)
I continued to teach piano lessons at home.(22--2)
How did you feel about being away(22--2)
when Susan and Richard were babies?(22--2)
I think I did the right thing(22--2)
for them and for myself and for Philip.(22--2)
We needed the money.Remember?(22--2)
Well, we do too, Ellen.(22--2)
Everything I earn helps us towards getting that house(22--2)
we want and need.(22--2)
I can't wait till he's just a little older.(22--2)
Our toy company makes the most wonderful toys for kids.(22--2)
Max thanks you.(22--2)
I thank you.(22--2)
And Richard thanks you.(22--2)
Now may I please say hello?(22--2)
Hello.(22--2)
Hello.(22--2)
I miss Max and think about him all week long.(22--2)
We talk about him at dinnertime.(22--2)
Will you please try to relax?(22--2)
I've never seen you so wound up.(22--2)
You seem to be enjoying the pressure.(22--2)
The truth is, I am.(22--2)
My job is not an easy one,(22--2)
but I really enjoy it.(22--2)
That is exactly what I wanted to talk to you about,Susan.(22--2)
What's the problem?(22--2)
Marilyn's career.(22--2)
Well, my choice of careers.(22--2)
Choice?(22--2)
My career as a fashion designer(22--2)
versus my career as a mother.(22--2)
Why does it have to be one or the other?(22--2)
That's what I said.(22--2)
How's that?(22--2)
Why can't you do both?(22--2)
She's right.(22--2)
Both?(22--2)
Well, that's what I do.(22--2)
I have a job, and I have Michelle.(22--2)
I take care of both to the best of my ability.(22--2)
It's not easy, but what is?(22--2)
And that's what I did.(22--2)
I did both with Richard and Susan,(22--2)
and I did both with Robbie.(22--2)
I thought you stayed home with Robbie?(22--2)
I did.(22--2)
But I was lucky enough to have a career as a music teacher(22--2)
which I could continue at home.(22--2)
Why can't you work at home, Marilyn?(22--2)
You're very talented.(22--2)
Designing dresses is a career(22--2)
you could establish out of your home,(22--2)
couldn't you?(22--2)
I don't know why I didn't think of it.(22--2)
It seems so simple now.(22--2)
For a year or two(22--2)
I could stay at home with Max and do my dress designs.(22--2)
And you could make your dresses at home.(22--2)
Sounds like a great way to solve the problem.(22--2)
That could solve your problem, Marilyn.(22--2)
I'm going to call Rita Mae at home(22--2)
and ask her to come by and talk about it.(22--2)
She wants to see Max, anyway.(22--2)
I think that really answers your questions, Marilyn.(22--2)
You can do it.(22--2)
Do your designs at home--here.(22--2)
And let Rita Mae do the selling at the boutique.(22--2)
And you can both benefit financially.(22--2)
I'm going to call Rita Mae right now.(22--2)
Oh, Susan, thank you so much(22--2)
for coming all this way from the city to talk to me about it.(22--2)
I hope you don't mind(22--2)
having taken so much time away from your busy schedule.(22--2)
Are you kidding?(22--2)
I don't mind at all.(22--2)
As a matter of fact,(22--2)
I came to spend some time with my favorite nephew.(22--2)
I think you should call Rita Mae right now.(22--2)
I think your idea of working at home is perfect.(22--2)
I don't know what I would do without you.(22--2)
I'm lucky to have you all.(22--2)
We are lucky to have you, Marilyn.(22--2)
And so is Max.(22--2)
Hi, big guy.(22--3)
That must be Rita Mae.(22--3)
She sure got here quickly.(22--3)
That's a good sign.(22--3)
She must like you and your work, Marilyn.(22--3)
I think she's just anxious to see Max.(22--3)
She loves children.(22--3)
Hi, Marilyn.(22--3)
Welcome.(22--3)
It's so nice of you to come.(22--3)
Oh, I just wanted to see your baby, Max.(22--3)
Hello, Rita Mae.(22--3)
I haven't seen you since the hospital.(22--3)
I'm Ellen Stewart, Marilyn's mother-in-law.(22--3)
We met at the hospital.Hello.(22--3)
-How are you?(22--3)
-I remember.(22--3)
How are you?(22--3)
Oh, and there is Max!(22--3)
Oh! My, how he's grown!(22--3)
A little present for Max.(22--3)
Oh, it's beautiful, Rita Mae!(22--3)
You shouldn't have.(22--3)
It's nothing.(22--3)
It's just a little present for Max.(22--3)
Can I get you some coffee or tea or a cold drink, Rita Mae?(22--3)
Oh, nothing, thank you.(22--3)
Well, I will leave you two to talk.(22--3)
Come on, you big guy.(22--3)
Yes, come on.(22--3)
That's it.(22--3)
It's nice seeing you.(22--3)
Let me know if you need anything.(22--3)
Thanks, Ellen.(22--3)
Thanks, Ellen.(22--3)
OK, Marilyn.(22--3)
You sounded like you've made a decision when you called me.(22--3)
I'm all ears.(22--3)
I have made a decision, Rita Mae.(22--3)
I've decided to stay at home and be a full-time mother.(22--3)
I'm disappointed, but I respect your decision.(22--3)
If I had a child as cute as Max,(22--3)
I might do the same thing.(22--3)
But I haven't finished telling you(22--3)
the other half of my decision.(22--3)
The other half?(22--3)
Yes.(22--3)
I think I can stay at home(22--3)
and take care of Max and continue my career.(22--3)
Sounds interesting.(22--3)
Let me hear it.(22--3)
Do you remember(22--3)
our talks about custom-designed dresses for the boutique?(22--3)
I sure do.(22--3)
Why can't I design dresses for you here at home?(22--3)
And make them here.(22--3)
Have the fittings here, too.(22--3)
And I could do the selling and the pricing at the boutique.(22--3)
Exactly.(22--3)
Oh!(22--3)
What kind of dresses would you design?(22--3)
I've thought about that for some time.(22--3)
Yes?(22--3)
Wedding dresses.(22--3)
Wedding dresses?(22--3)
Brilliant idea!(22--3)
There's a big market today in wedding dresses.(22--3)
That's what I thought.(22--3)
I like the idea very much.(22--3)
And if it's successful,(22--3)
we can expand to all kinds of dresses.(22--3)
That's what I thought.(22--3)
As a matter of fact,(22--3)
I have a customer for your first wedding dress.(22--3)
My niece is getting married,(22--3)
and I've been trying to find just the right thing for her.(22--3)
Marilyn, you're going to design my niece's dress.(22--3)
That'll be our first one,(22--3)
and then we'll use it to sell others.(22--3)
Do you really mean it?(22--3)
I really mean it.(22--3)
It's a simple idea, and it will work.(22--3)
You can certainly design dresses.(22--3)
I know that.(22--3)
And there's no reason why you can't do it from your home.(22--3)
I'm so excited!(22--3)
I can't wait to tell Richard!(22--3)
If I had a baby like Max,(22--3)
I'd want to stay home and be near him all the time, too.(22--3)
You're making the right decision(22--3)
for Max and for yourself too, Marilyn.(22--3)
It all sounds so easy.(22--3)
Now the hard work begins.(22--3)
Would you like to see some of my designs that I've been working on?(22--3)
I'd love to.(22--3)
Ooh! Oh, that's wonderful!(22--3)
Ooh(22--3)
Morning, Grandpa.(23--1)
Is something the matter, Grandpa?(23--1)
The editorial in this paper has my friend Nat Baker real upset.(23--1)
Ah! I'll read it to you.(23--1)
"The old library building on Chestnut Street,(23--1)
which has been vacant for over a year now,(23--1)
was supposed to be made into a community center(23--1)
to serve the senior citizens(23--1)
as well as the younger people of Riverdale.(23--1)
Due to lack of funds(23--1)
for the repainting of the interior of the building(23--1)
and for the furniture needed,(23--1)
the plans for the community center(23--1)
have been postponed indefinitely."(23--1)
He's coming over to talk about it.(23--1)
Is it that serious a problem, Grandpa?(23--1)
It is.(23--1)
Nat's not as lucky as I am, Robbie.(23--1)
He doesn't have any family with him.(23--1)
He lives alone(23--1)
and depends on places like a community center(23--1)
to be with people--people his own age.(23--1)
But there's the old community center on Elm Street.(23--1)
It's small,(23--1)
and the problem is that it's set up primarily for kids to play.(23--1)
Ping-Pong tables, soda machines, and lots of music.(23--1)
It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.(23--1)
I never realized that.(23--1)
It's hard for some older people to take all that noise.(23--1)
That's why the new community center is a good idea.(23--1)
Part of the building for older people,(23--1)
part of the building for younger people.(23--1)
I see what you mean.(23--1)
That must be Nat.(23--1)
It could be Alexandra.(23--1)
She's coming over this morning to help me with my math.(23--1)
Hi, Robbie.(23--1)
Hi, Alexandra. Come on in.(23--1)
Do you want something cold to drink?(23--1)
I'd love some cola, please.(23--1)
Cola coming up.(23--1)
I really appreciate you coming over to help me with my math.(23--1)
My final exam is next Tuesday.(23--1)
You're so good in all your other subjects.(23--1)
I just can't understand(23--1)
why you have so many problems with math.(23--1)
Hi, Alexandra.(23--1)
Hi, Mr. Stewart.(23--1)
I thought that was Nat Baker who rang the front doorbell.(23--1)
Don't let me interrupt you.(23--1)
No problem, Grandpa.(23--1)
We're just having some cola(23--1)
before getting to the tough stuff--math.(23--1)
He'll do anything to avoid getting down to math lessons,(23--1)
Mr. Stewart.(23--1)
I was the same way.(23--1)
Really, Grandpa?(23--1)
Really. I didn't like math.(23--1)
I wasn't good at it, and I didn't like studying it.(23--1)
But you had to be good at math.(23--1)
You graduated from engineering school.(23--1)
I was. But not in high school.(23--1)
For some reason, I couldn't get a handle on it.(23--1)
Then, in college, I became good at it.(23--1)
Then there's hope for Robbie.(23--1)
I can't wait.(23--1)
You think I can just skip it now and get to it at college?(23--1)
You'll never get to college to find out, Robbie,(23--1)
if you skip it now.(23--1)
That must be Nat.(23--1)
Sit down, Robbie. Let's get to work.(23--1)
I'd like you to meet my friend Nat Baker.(23--1)
This is Alexandra Pappas, and this is my grandson Robbie,(23--1)
whom I think you've met once or twice before.(23--1)
Nice to meet you, Mr. Baker.(23--1)
Hi, Mr. Baker. We met before.(23--1)
Where?(23--1)
In town. At the hardware store.(23--1)
I remember now. Right. Hi.(23--1)
Hello, Alexandra.(23--1)
Don't let us keep you from your math tutoring, Robbie.(23--1)
I know you want to get to it.(23--1)
Stay ... stay.(23--1)
I told you. He'll use any excuse to avoid math.(23--1)
Did you read the story in the paper, Malcolm?(23--1)
I did.(23--1)
It's a serious matter for a lot of us.(23--1)
A serious matter.(23--1)
It is. Come on out to the patio.(23--1)
We'll talk about it out there.(23--1)
Thanks. Nice to meet you ... again.(23--1)
What's the problem?(23--1)
Come on! You'll hear about it.(23--1)
There is a way, Malcolm.(23--2)
We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.(23--2)
It's certainly a good idea.(23--2)
If I could take a look at the place,(23--2)
I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up.(23--2)
How much paint, how many hours of work...(23--2)
That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.(23--2)
If you would supervise the refurbishing,(23--2)
I'll find the people to help do it.(23--2)
I'll help too, Mr. Baker.(23--2)
I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood(23--2)
and collect the furniture we need.(23--2)
I'll help.(23--2)
Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.(23--2)
Can we help?(23--2)
I'd really like to.(23--2)
Sure.(23--2)
We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie.(23--2)
Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture,(23--2)
but to help with the paint job.(23--2)
That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.(23--2)
I'll do it. I'll talk to them.(23--2)
And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?(23--2)
Tomorrow morning it is.(23--2)
Come in,come in.Please,come in.(23--2)
I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart.(23--2)
Malcolm, this is Joanne Thompson.(23--2)
Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.(23--2)
My pleasure, Malcolm.(23--2)
And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.(23--2)
He ran the drugstore(23--2)
and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.(23--2)
Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.(23--2)
Hello, Mr. Stewart.(23--2)
Malcolm, please.(23--2)
Hello, Malcolm.(23--2)
Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee.(23--2)
And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.(23--2)
Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra?(23--2)
Weren't they going to be here this morning?(23--2)
I thought so, too.(23--2)
I'm surprised they're not here.(23--2)
Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra.(23--2)
Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but...(23--2)
It's OK. I'm sure they meant well,(23--2)
but they probably had other things on their minds.(23--2)
I understand you used to be in the construction business,(23--2)
Malcolm.(23--2)
I was, indeed.(23--2)
I wonder if you would take a look at the old library(23--2)
and make sure that it is in good condition(23--2)
so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.(23--2)
When can I do that? I'd be happy to.(23--2)
We've got permission to go inside the old building(23--2)
during the week--(23--2)
Tuesday or Wednesday.(23--2)
That's fine with me. I can do it either day.(23--2)
That would be very helpful.(23--2)
I think the building just needs a good cleaning.(23--2)
And a good paint job.(23--2)
Then we have to furnish it.(23--2)
I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting.(23--2)
They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.(23--2)
Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime,(23--2)
let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.(23--2)
OK.(23--2)
Go ahead, Joanne.(23--2)
As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.(23--2)
This place can be developed(23--2)
with one real intergenerational program.(23--2)
That's an idea I like.(23--2)
A community center(23--2)
with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.(23--2)
And programs that don't leave anyone out.(23--2)
It's asking a lot.(23--2)
But we can't do it without talking to the young people.(23--2)
Finding out what they want.(23--2)
If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.(23--2)
Don't be upset, Malcolm.(23--2)
We'll have a chance to talk to them later.(23--2)
It's not like Robbie.(23--2)
If he says he's going to be here, he's here.(23--2)
I wonder what the problem is.(23--2)
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.(23--3)
But Alexandra and I(23--3)
have been busy at work this morning(23--3)
on the community-center project.(23--3)
And we brought someone along who can help.(23--3)
You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa?(23--3)
He's the editor of the Riverdale paper.(23--3)
He wrote some nice articles on Mom(23--3)
when she was running for the school board.(23--3)
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.(23--3)
Hi, Mr. Stewart.(23--3)
Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project.(23--3)
From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me,(23--3)
you people are making one big story.(23--3)
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell.(23--3)
This is Nat Baker,(23--3)
who's responsible for this meeting,(23--3)
and this is Joanne Thompson--and Abe Lucas,(23--3)
who used to run the drugstore in town.(23--3)
Robbie and Alexandra told me(23--3)
what you need to fix up the old library.(23--3)
I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.(23--3)
Let's go. What are your questions?(23--3)
OK.Now,I have...first...a couple of questions here.(23--3)
Have you talked to the community council?(23--3)
And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?(23--3)
OK, what do you need most of all?(23--3)
People power.(23--3)
Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.(23--3)
To do what?(23--3)
To help scrub the building interior clean.(23--3)
So that we can repaint it.(23--3)
And you also need bodies to do repainting?(23--3)
That's right.(23--3)
And we'll also need some ladders(23--3)
and some brushes and some paint.(23--3)
When do you need the volunteers,(23--3)
and where do they report?(23--3)
I've got the council to agree(23--3)
to open the building for us on the next four weekends.(23--3)
How about furnishings?(23--3)
Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?(23--3)
Yes.(23--3)
Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.(23--3)
Let's see. Four desks.(23--3)
Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs.(23--3)
Six table lamps. Three end tables. One piano.(23--3)
This is a good start.(23--3)
These items shouldn't be difficult to come by(23--3)
once I print the article in the paper.(23--3)
This community has always been very generous.(23--3)
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.(23--3)
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed,(23--3)
we need to put together volunteers(23--3)
from the various generations of future users.(23--3)
That's right.(23--3)
And without their energy and stamina,(23--3)
there's no way we can complete this project.(23--3)
I've got it. Now give me some information about(23--3)
how you see the building being used.(23--3)
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area...(23--3)
It's here, Robbie.(23--3)
Charles Maxwell lived up to his word.(23--3)
"At the Stewart family home on Linden Street yesterday,(23--3)
a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered(23--3)
to plan the refurbishing of the old library(23--3)
to transform it into a new community center.(23--3)
The original plan by the council(23--3)
was tabled because of lack of funds.(23--3)
The new plan needs you.(23--3)
You could call it a community unity plan.(23--3)
It needs your time, and it needs your energy.(23--3)
And it needs your contributions of furniture,(23--3)
paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera.(23--3)
A list of these items and a volunteer form(23--3)
can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices.(23--3)
By working together,(23--3)
this community can do anything to benefit its citizens,(23--3)
and we know you will all work together(23--3)
towards refurbishing the old library(23--3)
and making it a new community center.(23--3)
Charles Maxwell, Editor."(23--3)
Hi, Mom.(24--1)
Hi, Robbie.(24--1)
You're home from school early.(24--1)
Yeah, they're getting the assembly hall(24--1)
ready for the graduation ceremony,(24--1)
so we all got to go home early.(24--1)
Too noisy to study.(24--1)
Well, now that you're here,(24--1)
you can help me with dinner.(24--1)
I need those potatoes peeled and sliced.(24--1)
Mom, give me a break.(24--1)
Alexandra's coming over to help me study for my math final(24--1)
Well, in that case,(24--1)
you can wash the dishes and clean up after dinner.(24--1)
Can I invite Alexandra to stay for dinner?(24--1)
Of course.(24--1)
Thanks, Mom.(24--1)
You and Alexandra(24--1)
have become good friends, haven't you?(24--1)
Yes. I like her.(24--1)
She's a terrific person.(24--1)
I'm going to miss her(24--1)
when she goes back to Greece.(24--1)
Would you like to give her a little farewell party?(24--1)
Mom, that would be terrific!(24--1)
Maybe we could make it a surprise.(24--1)
Oh, I don't know.(24--1)
Surprise parties don't always work out.(24--1)
Well, we could tell her(24--1)
it's a graduation party for me.(24--1)
When Alexandra arrives,(24--1)
we'll surprise her.(24--1)
Well, I suppose that might work.(24--1)
I'd like to give her a nice going-away present.(24--1)
Fine.(24--1)
There's only one problem.(24--1)
What's that?(24--1)
I'm broke.(24--1)
I should have saved some money.(24--1)
I'm sure Alexandra(24--1)
would be happy with something simple, Robbie.(24--1)
I know.(24--1)
But, well,(24--1)
I'd like to give her something nice(24--1)
to remember me by.(24--1)
Maybe I could borrow some money from you and Dad.(24--1)
It's all right with me(24--1)
if it's all right with your dad.(24--1)
Thanks, Mom.(24--1)
I'll talk to him.(24--1)
Is he still in his office?(24--1)
I think so.(24--1)
Thanks, Mom.(24--1)
Robbie! Good luck!(24--1)
Here are the X-rays you wanted, Dr. Stewart.(24--1)
Oh. Thank you, Molly.(24--1)
Now, let me check them.(24--1)
What do you think?(24--1)
I don't see any breaks or fractures.(24--1)
Well,well.Thank you,Molly.(24--1)
Thank you.(24--1)
Come in!(24--1)
Hi, Son.(24--1)
Hi, Dad. Am I interrupting you?(24--1)
No, no, no, no.(24--1)
What's up?(24--1)
Can we talk?(24--1)
Sure.(24--1)
I need some help.(24--1)
Well, that's what fathers are for.(24--1)
Well, before I go to college,(24--1)
I have the whole summer...(24--1)
Yes ...(24--1)
And I'm planning to get a job for the summer.(24--1)
And what sort of job?(24--1)
I applied for a job as a lifeguard at the community pool.(24--1)
Sounds pretty good.(24--1)
Yes. I'll be earning pretty good money if I get it.(24--1)
But right now, I'm kind of short of cash.(24--1)
Who isn't?(24--1)
And my friend Alexandra is going back to Greece...(24--1)
Nice girl.(24--1)
We'll all miss her.(24--1)
Mom says we can give her a going-away surprise party.(24--1)
Good idea.(24--1)
And I'd like to get her a nice gift...(24--1)
What'd you have in mind?(24--1)
Well, a wristwatch,(24--1)
so she'll think of me when she looks at the time.(24--1)
Nothing flashy or expensive.(24--1)
Something simple--but a good one.(24--1)
Sounds fine, Robbie.(24--1)
Well, I saw a nice watch.(24--1)
But I'll need a loan.(24--1)
If you could lend me the money,(24--1)
I could pay you back out of my lifeguard salary.(24--1)
Well, I guess your mother and I can manage it.(24--1)
When do you need the money?(24--1)
Would tomorrow be OK?(24--1)
You've got it.(24--1)
Thanks, Dad.(24--1)
My pleasure, Son.(24--1)
Oh, and, Robbie...(24--1)
Yes?(24--1)
You'll probably want the family car(24--1)
so you can drive her home after the party.(24--1)
Could I?(24--1)
If you drive carefully.(24--1)
I will. Thanks, Dad.(24--1)
My pleasure.(24--1)
You're OK, Dad.(24--1)
You're not so bad yourself, Son.(24--1)
You ready for the next problem?(24--2)
You know what?(24--2)
I can't look at another number.(24--2)
How about a lemonade break?(24--2)
Sure.(24--2)
Oh, by the way,(24--2)
when is your plane reservation for your flight to Athens?(24--2)
Sunday. Why?(24--2)
Would you be able to come over Saturday night?(24--2)
Yes.(24--2)
I should be finished packing by then.(24--2)
My folks are giving me a little graduation party.(24--2)
Terrific!(24--2)
I'll pick you up.(24--2)
That isn't necessary.(24--2)
My dad's letting me borrow the car.(24--2)
Oh, well, that would be very nice.(24--2)
About eight o'clock?(24--2)
Eight o'clock is fine.(24--2)
Great! It's a date.(24--2)
Who's going to be there?(24--2)
Just my friend Mike and a few kids from school.(24--2)
I'm going to miss all of you.(24--2)
You've been like a second family to me.(24--2)
We're going to miss you.(24--2)
Maybe you could come to visit me in Greece?(24--2)
I'm counting on it.(24--2)
Wonderful!(24--2)
Are you excited about graduating from high school?(24--2)
Sure ... and a little scared.(24--2)
Scared? Why?(24--2)
Aren't you a little scared?(24--2)
I was when I first came to the United States.(24--2)
I'd never been away from home,(24--2)
and I didn't know what it would be like.(24--2)
But then I found out that people are the same everywhere(24--2)
once you get to know them.(24--2)
I'm glad I got to know you.(24--2)
Thank you.(24--2)
I'm glad I got to know you--and your family.(24--2)
Wouldn't it be nice if we could skip the examinations(24--2)
and get right to the graduation party?(24--2)
It would be very nice.(24--2)
But that isn't the way it works.(24--2)
So ... back to work.(24--2)
Good night, Robbie.(24--2)
Good night, Mrs. Stewart.(24--2)
Thank you for dinner.(24--2)
Good night, Alexandra.(24--2)
Will you be all right?(24--2)
Yes. The Molinas are waiting for me.(24--2)
Good night, Alexandra.(24--2)
I'll pick you up on Saturday night, OK?(24--2)
Yes. Eight o'clock.(24--2)
I have to run.(24--2)
Good night, Robbie.(24--2)
She's really a good friend, isn't she?(24--2)
Yeah.(24--2)
You are going to miss her.(24--2)
Am I going to miss her?(24--2)
That's what I said!(24--2)
You are going to miss her!(24--2)
I'm going to miss her,(24--2)
and my math teacher's going to miss her.(24--2)
Well, you can write to her.(24--2)
It's not the same.(24--2)
How does that look, Rob?(24--2)
Great! Pass me the hammer.(24--2)
You got it!(24--2)
You're sure Alexandra's going to be surprised?(24--2)
Absolutely.(24--2)
She has no idea that the party is in her honor.(24--2)
Millie, did you bring the tapes for dancing?(24--2)
They're in my bag.(24--2)
What did you bring?(24--2)
Some rock 'n' roll.(24--2)
Perfect! Alexandra will love it!(24--2)
I can't wait to see her face when she walks in here tonight.(24--2)
What about the cake?(24--2)
My mom's decorating it right now.(24--2)
Robbie, there's a phone call for you.(24--2)
It's Alexandra.(24--2)
She sounds upset.(24--2)
OK.Thanks, Mom.(24--2)
I'll take it in there.(24--2)
Hi, Alexandra.(24--2)
What? You what?(24--2)
Oh no!(24--2)
How about some music?(24--3)
No, let's wait till Robbie gets back from the airport.(24--3)
Did she say why she had to leave today?(24--3)
She told Robbie that her flight tomorrow was canceled,(24--3)
so she had to take an earlier flight today.(24--3)
This is terrible.(24--3)
Well, that must be him.(24--3)
Why is he blowing his horn like that?(24--3)
I don't know.(24--3)
Maybe he's angry.(24--3)
Do you think we should take down the decorations?(24--3)
They'll just make him sad.(24--3)
Too late now.(24--3)
We should have done it sooner.(24--3)
Oh, here he comes.(24--3)
Hi.(24--3)
How'd it go?(24--3)
OK, I guess.(24--3)
Especially when Alexandra gave me a surprise...(24--3)
Yeah? What was it?(24--3)
This!(24--3)
Alexandra!(24--3)
Hi! What happened?(24--3)
I called my parents from the airport.(24--3)
When I told them(24--3)
my friends were giving me a party,(24--3)
they insisted that I stay.(24--3)
So now I'm taking a flight on Monday instead.(24--3)
That's great! Terrific!(24--3)
But how did you know the party was for you?(24--3)
Well, Robbie told me when he gave me this.(24--3)
Oh, it's so pretty!(24--3)
It's lovely, Robbie.(24--3)
All right!(24--3)
Now we can really start the party!(24--3)
No. Would you mind?(24--3)
I'd like to say something first.(24--3)
Hear, hear!(24--3)
I would just like to thank all of you,(24--3)
my friends,(24--3)
who have made my stay in the United States so wonderful.(24--3)
And to Robbie and the Stewart family(24--3)
for opening their home to me.(24--3)
We should thank you.(24--3)
You're a real friend!(24--3)
And I also have a little surprise for you, Robbie.(24--3)
A little going-away present.(24--3)
Thank you.(24--3)
Open it, please.(24--3)
I think you might be amused.(24--3)
OK. I can't believe it!(24--3)
I guess we were thinking the same thought.(24--3)
You had it engraved!(24--3)
Read it, Robbie.(24--3)
"In friendship, always. Alexandra."(24--3)
I knew we thought alike,(24--3)
but this is too much!(24--3)
Thank you.(24--3)
All right!(24--3)
Let's have some music!(24--3)
Miss Pappas?(24--3)
Mr. Stewart ...(24--3)
Mrs. Stewart, may I have this dance?(24--3)
My pleasure, Doctor.(24--3)
Hot dogs. I love hot dogs.(25--1)
There is nothing better than a hot dog in the country.(25--1)
Hot dogs and mustard.(25--1)
Cooked outdoors over an open fire.(25--1)
I wish I had one now.(25--1)
Do you remember when Daddy and I used to take you(25--1)
and Susan and Robbie to Jones Beach?(25--1)
Oh, I sure do.(25--1)
We'd wait until dark and make a fire,(25--1)
and we'd cook the hot dogs.(25--1)
Oh, don't forget the mustard.(25--1)
And, oh, does anybody want ketchup?(25--1)
I might as well take it along.(25--1)
And now to make sure we've got the hamburger patties.(25--1)
I have to remember to put them in the bag(25--1)
tomorrow morning before we leave.(25--1)
I'll remind you, Richard.(25--1)
Mom,(25--1)
we really appreciate your taking care of Max for the weekend(25--1)
and giving up your free time.(25--1)
I love doing it.(25--1)
Susan and Harry have a sitter for Michelle in the city,(25--1)
and I'm taking care of Max.(25--1)
It's no big deal.(25--1)
I am happy to do it for you.(25--1)
I guess Max is asleep by now.(25--1)
He's not crying anymore.(25--1)
Oh, poor baby. He's teething.(25--1)
Well, he's asleep--finally.(25--1)
I feel so bad for him.(25--1)
It hurts so much when a baby gets his first teeth.(25--1)
He'll be fine, Marilyn.(25--1)
Well, he wakes up several times during the night,(25--1)
and the pain is so bad.(25--1)
I'm really concerned about going away for the weekend, Ellen,(25--1)
and leaving you with the full responsibility of taking care of Max.(25--1)
Especially with his teething.(25--1)
I wish he felt better.(25--1)
Please don't worry, Marilyn.(25--1)
Remember your father-in-law's a pediatrician.(25--1)
We have a live-in doctor if there's a problem I can't handle.(25--1)
I agree, Marilyn.(25--1)
We really don't have to be overly concerned.(25--1)
I'll go upstairs and stay with him until he falls asleep again.(25--1)
Thanks, Richard.(25--1)
Try putting him across your lap on his stomach.(25--1)
He likes that.(25--1)
I'll try it.(25--1)
When are Susan and Harry picking you up, Marilyn?(25--1)
They're coming by at six tomorrow morning,(25--1)
so we can get an early start.(25--1)
That's nice.(25--1)
And you'll have a full day in the country.(25--1)
And a full night.(25--1)
Tomorrow night we'll be camping out in tents.(25--1)
And coming home on Sunday?(25--1)
We'll be heading back late in the afternoon.(25--1)
You're going to have the time of your lives.(25--1)
Camping out is such great fun.(25--1)
We'll have a great time camping out, I'm sure.(25--1)
But I'm still a little worried about you, Ellen.(25--1)
It will be my great pleasure, Marilyn.(25--1)
Remember, it's only one night.(25--1)
He's asleep.(25--1)
I think he'll sleep through the night now.(25--1)
Thanks, honey.(25--1)
I hope he's good when we're away.(25--1)
Well, so do I.(25--1)
Now, to check the list of things we need for the camping trip.(25--1)
We need to bring a flashlight.(25--1)
It's in the right-hand drawer, next to the bottle openers.(25--1)
Do we have a bottle opener on the list, Marilyn?(25--1)
No. No bottle opener.(25--1)
Is that one of the things Susan and Harry are bringing?(25--1)
No.(25--1)
And we're bringing the ketchup, mustard, relish--all that stuff.(25--1)
And cooking utensils.(25--1)
Well, here's the bottle opener, and here's the flashlight.(25--1)
Matches.(25--1)
Matches?(25--1)
Yes, of course.(25--1)
For when we build our campfire.(25--1)
I can't build a fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together.(25--1)
And don't forget your camera and film, Richard.(25--1)
All packed and ready.(25--1)
And let's not forget our cassette player and some tapes.(25--1)
Some music tapes and some blank tapes(25--1)
so that we can record our thoughts about the trip.(25--1)
Oh, that's a nice idea.(25--1)
An audio diary.(25--1)
That's what I thought.(25--1)
Got it!(25--1)
The cassette player and the tapes.(25--1)
Oh, I love it!(25--2)
I love it!(25--2)
To be away from the city on such a beautiful day(25--2)
is my idea of heaven!(25--2)
The grass. The trees. The fresh air.(25--2)
I told you you'd like it. I've been doing this for years.(25--2)
You have the spirit of a teenager, Susan.(25--2)
Wait till you see yourself jumping around.(25--2)
That's what I love about Susan.(25--2)
She works hard.(25--2)
She plays hard.(25--2)
She's a real Stewart.(25--2)
Come on, Richard.(25--2)
Help me get this stuff out of the car.(25--2)
Where does it go?(25--2)
Well, we'll put everything over there.(25--2)
We'll set up our tents over there by the edge of the woods.(25--2)
Then we'll be able to make our fire there where it's safe.(25--2)
Oh, there's our table and benches.(25--2)
All set for eating.(25--2)
That's what makes this spot so good.(25--2)
Is anybody hungry?(25--2)
I am.(25--2)
We just got here.(25--2)
When you're out in the fresh air like this, it makes you hungry.(25--2)
Aren't you hungry, Marilyn?(25--2)
I sure am.(25--2)
How about you, Richard?(25--2)
Starving.(25--2)
You guys are like three kids.(25--2)
Aren't you hungry, Harry?(25--2)
Well, yeah.(25--2)
Now that you mention it, I guess I am.(25--2)
I mean,(25--2)
how could a guy not be hungry with all this talk about eating?(25--2)
Where's the bag with the chicken salad sandwiches?(25--2)
Right here, next to the ice packs. Here.(25--2)
Put the tablecloth on the picnic table,(25--2)
and I will bring the cola and the plastic cups.(25--2)
Well, how do you like it so far?(25--2)
I've never been more relaxed.(25--2)
Me, neither.(25--2)
I wish we had brought Michelle, Harry.(25--2)
She would have loved it.(25--2)
Oh, you're right.(25--2)
I wish we had brought Max.(25--2)
Marilyn, Susan, let's not begin to worry about Michelle and Max.(25--2)
We're having a good time, and they're in good hands.(25--2)
Richard is right.(25--2)
Are you having a good time, Susan?(25--2)
You haven't answered my question.(25--2)
I am having a good time, Harry.(25--2)
I promise not to think about the city.(25--2)
We're in the country.(25--2)
Let's all just enjoy this wonderful place(25--2)
and this wonderful weather.(25--2)
Good.(25--2)
This is heaven, Harry!(25--2)
It was such a great idea to spend the weekend this way.(25--2)
Thanks, Susan.(25--2)
I thought you'd all like it.(25--2)
Like it? I love it!(25--2)
Listen to the sounds of the summer that surround us.(25--2)
It's so calming.(25--2)
I've always liked camping out.(25--2)
Away from the telephones and account books.(25--2)
It's refreshing for me.(25--2)
I always go back to the city in a wonderful state of mind.(25--2)
We've only been here for a day,(25--2)
and I've completely forgotten about all my business problems.(25--2)
The office seems so far away.(25--2)
I'm glad you like it, Susan.(25--2)
We'll spend many more weekends like this.(25--2)
And next time we'll bring Michelle.(25--2)
I wish she were here with us to enjoy the country.(25--2)
And next time we'll bring Michelle.(25--2)
Just listen to the sound.(25--2)
It's so soothing.(25--2)
I can hardly keep my eyes open.(25--2)
If only we could bottle the fresh air.(25--2)
Wouldn't it be wonderful?(25--2)
We could call it "Deep Sleep Country Air."(25--2)
It puts you to sleep.(25--2)
So does the sound.(25--2)
I've been having a hard time keeping my eyes open(25--2)
just listening to it.(25--2)
It's like a special music.(25--2)
Too bad we can't bottle the sound.(25--2)
But we can!(25--2)
Can what?(25--2)
Bottle the sound.(25--2)
What are you talking about?(25--2)
Oh, yeah!(25--2)
Great idea!(25--2)
Let's do it!(25--2)
I'm so glad everyone is asleep.(25--3)
I thought Max would be crying, and everybody would be awake.(25--3)
What did I tell you?(25--3)
Nothing to worry about.(25--3)
I'm sure everything is fine.(25--3)
My mother knows all there is to know(25--3)
about taking care of babies, I assure you.(25--3)
Let's put some of this stuff away and then take off.(25--3)
We've got a forty-minute drive into the city.(25--3)
Welcome home--(25--3)
and I do mean welcome home.(25--3)
Something wrong?(25--3)
Oh, nothing's wrong, Richard.(25--3)
Believe me, Max is fine.(25--3)
But his teeth hurt, and he just can't get to sleep, poor dear.(25--3)
Neither can you.(25--3)
Oh, I feel so bad.(25--3)
Oh, I'm fine.(25--3)
How was your weekend?(25--3)
We had a great time, Mom.(25--3)
It was wonderful.(25--3)
The weather couldn't have been better.(25--3)
It was nice here, too.(25--3)
Did you get a chance to get outside at all?(25--3)
Oh, yes.(25--3)
Grandpa helped me yesterday afternoon.(25--3)
I went to the supermarket to get a few things,(25--3)
and I stayed out an extra half hour.(25--3)
The village was filled with people--the weather was so nice.(25--3)
Harry's a professional camper, Mom.(25--3)
He knows all there is to know,(25--3)
and he made the weekend very easy for us to enjoy.(25--3)
Come on. You all helped.(25--3)
You were wonderful, Harry!(25--3)
Why don't you go to your room, Mom, and get some sleep.(25--3)
Oh, I'm fine.(25--3)
Tell me more about your weekend.(25--3)
Did you do anything special?(25--3)
Lots of special country things.(25--3)
We picked flowers.(25--3)
And we brought some home for you.(25--3)
It was so nice to be out in the country.(25--3)
They smell wonderful.(25--3)
Everything smelled so special.(25--3)
It would have been great if we had been able to bottle the smells.(25--3)
It would be a great business if you could do that.(25--3)
Oh!(25--3)
Uh, we're home now, Ellen.(25--3)
We'll take care of it.(25--3)
I'll take care of it.(25--3)
Let's see if it works.(25--3)
What's that?(25--3)
A little special country music.(25--3)
I think we'd better head home.(25--3)
It's getting late, and we have a bit of a drive.(25--3)
Well, all your things are inside.(25--3)
There's your sleeping bag.(25--3)
Oh, thanks, Harry.(25--3)
Say good-bye to Richard.(25--3)
We'll call you all tomorrow night.(25--3)
Good-bye.(25--3)
-Bye, Mom.(25--3)
-Bye-bye.(25--3)
I'm so tired I think I'm overtired.(25--3)
I don't know if I can get to sleep.(25--3)
Max has stopped crying.(25--3)
Yes. It works!(25--3)
It works!(25--3)
What works?(25--3)
This.(25--3)
Oh. Oh, where did you get that?(25--3)
It sounds so nice.(25--3)
I think I'm falling asleep.(25--3)
Like Max did.(25--3)
-Good night.(25--3)
-Good night.(25--3)
Sounds of the country.(25--3)
The soothing sounds of the country.(25--3)
A little further to the right, Tom.(26--1)
Is this OK?(26--1)
Good. What do you think, Richard?(26--1)
I like it there.(26--1)
It's the first thing people will see when they come in.(26--1)
It sets the tone for the whole show.(26--1)
The next thing they'll see is(26--1)
this enlargement with the words Family Album, U.S.A.(26--1)
I can't believe this is really happening!(26--1)
You've earned it.(26--1)
Years of work went into these pictures.(26--1)
I know, but it's still a dream come true.(26--1)
Well, remember,(26--1)
we're not sure(26--1)
what the critics are going to write about your show yet.(26--1)
And you never know(26--1)
what the man from the New York Times is going to say about it.(26--1)
Are you worried?(26--1)
I always worry.(26--1)
The reviews of this show(26--1)
are important for the sales of your book.(26--1)
When do we see the reviews?(26--1)
Soon.(26--1)
One of the critics is coming over this morning for a preview.(26--1)
I hope he's in a good mood.(26--1)
So do I.(26--1)
Marilyn and I hope to use money from the sales of this book(26--1)
to buy a new house.(26--1)
The book will be a success.(26--1)
And the show will help promote it.(26--1)
Speaking of promoting the book,(26--1)
do I really have to(26--1)
autograph copies for the guests at the opening?(26--1)
It's common practice.(26--1)
I feel uncomfortable about it.(26--1)
A lot of people come to openings(26--1)
just so they can get(26--1)
the autograph of somebody who may be famous someday.(26--1)
Couldn't we wait until I'm famous?(26--1)
That might be sooner than you think.(26--1)
This one over here, Mr. Carlson?(26--1)
A little further back, Tom.(26--1)
It's too close to the refreshments.(26--1)
No, I think this one belongs in the "people-at-work" section.(26--1)
You may be right.(26--1)
Try it there, Tom.(26--1)
Right.(26--1)
Nervous about the opening tonight?(26--1)
Nervous?Me?(26--1)
No. I'm scared to death.(26--1)
How about guests?(26--1)
How many people will you be bringing?(26--1)
Well, my family, I guess.(26--1)
My wife Marilyn, my father and mother,(26--1)
my brother Robbie,(26--1)
my sister and her husband and their daughter.(26--1)
And my grandfather.(26--1)
Is that too many?(26--1)
No such thing as "too many" at an opening.(26--1)
I hope they like it.(26--1)
Your family or the public?(26--1)
Everybody.(26--1)
But especially my family.(26--1)
They've stood by me through all this.(26--1)
I'm sure they'll like it.(26--1)
Harvey, how are you?(26--1)
Mitchell, so nice of you to come.(26--1)
Richard, this is Mitchell Johnson.(26--1)
Mitchell is(26--1)
one of the most important syndicated reviewers in the country.(26--1)
Well, you're the young man who did all this.(26--1)
I'm afraid so.(26--1)
Nice to meet you.(26--1)
Nice to meet you, Mr. Johnson.(26--1)
Mitchell has always encouraged new talent.(26--1)
Well ... you mind if I look around(26--1)
and see what it says to me?(26--1)
Be our guest.(26--1)
Mm-hmm, hmm, uh-huh.(26--1)
What does that mean when he goes,(26--1)
"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm"?(26--1)
It probably means he's clearing his throat.(26--1)
I don't know.(26--1)
I don't care what the critics say, Mr. Stewart.(26--1)
Your work is brilliant.(26--1)
Thank you, Tom.(26--1)
Tom is studying photography at NYU.(26--1)
He's working with me during the summer months as an intern.(26--1)
Oh, really?(26--1)
I'd like to see your work.(26--1)
It's not good enough to show.(26--1)
I'm still learning.(26--1)
Oh, I'd still like to see your work.(26--1)
You may be the next Ansel Adams and not even know it.(26--1)
If you really mean it,(26--1)
I'll bring some of my pictures into the gallery.(26--1)
I do mean it.(26--1)
Very interesting pictures, Mr. Stewart.(26--1)
You have a most unusual eye.(26--1)
Thank you.(26--1)
I hope that's a compliment.(26--1)
It is.(26--1)
Are you going to be reviewing the show, Mitchell?(26--1)
Oh,yes.It's definitely worth reviewing.(26--1)
Favorably?(26--1)
Oh, you know I never answer that question, Harvey.(26--1)
I'd like an advance copy of the book, though,(26--1)
so I can study it.(26--1)
I have an autographed one in my office.(26--1)
Tom, would you give Mr. Johnson(26--1)
the copy of Richard's book on my desk?(26--1)
Just follow me, Mr. Johnson.(26--1)
Sure.(26--1)
Do you think he liked my photographs?(26--1)
We'll know when tonight's papers come out.(26--1)
Keep your fingers crossed.(26--1)
Do you like the dress?(26--2)
I love it.(26--2)
I designed it myself.(26--2)
It's beautiful.(26--2)
Are you ready?(26--2)
We're supposed to be there(26--2)
before the guests arrive.(26--2)
I know. I know.(26--2)
Help me with this tie, will you?(26--2)
Honey, I'm scared to death.(26--2)
But this is what you've been working for all these years.(26--2)
No, no.(26--2)
I worked to put together a book of photographs.(26--2)
This is show business.(26--2)
Well, it's all part of the same job.(26--2)
Just relax and enjoy it.(26--2)
You're right.(26--2)
I earned this,and I'm going to enjoy it.(26--2)
As soon as I recover from my nervous breakdown.(26--2)
What are you afraid of?(26--2)
Everything.(26--2)
A critic was there this morning.(26--2)
He probably hates my work.(26--2)
I have to sign copies of my book for a lot of people(26--2)
I never met before.(26--2)
My new shoes hurt my feet...(26--2)
You're going to be a great success.(26--2)
Are you ready?(26--2)
As soon as I get these cuff links on.(26--2)
Let me help.(26--2)
Mom and Dad are already on their way down to the gallery.(26--2)
There! You look very attractive.(26--2)
Thank you.(26--2)
Well, I suppose I've run out of excuses.(26--2)
Mm-hmm. Let's go ...(26--2)
Oh, one minute.(26--2)
Before we go to the gallery,(26--2)
I just want to tell you(26--2)
that I never could have done this book(26--2)
without your help and your love.(26--2)
I appreciate it.(26--2)
Thanks.(26--2)
Now, no more stalling.(26--2)
What is it?(26--2)
There's nobody here!(26--2)
Of course not, Richard.(26--2)
Your show doesn't begin until eight thirty.(26--2)
Oh. Right.(26--2)
Richard! Welcome! Good luck tonight!(26--2)
Well, thanks.(26--2)
This is my publisher, Harvey Carlson.(26--2)
You've met my wife Marilyn...(26--2)
-Charmed.(26--2)
-Hi(26--2)
My mother, Ellen Stewart.(26--2)
Harvey Carlson.(26--2)
It's good to meet you.(26--2)
This is my father, Dr. Philip Stewart...(26--2)
Nice to meet you, Mr. Carlson.(26--2)
My brother Robbie...(26--2)
Hi.(26--2)
Hi.(26--2)
And this is my sister Susan and her husband Harry Bennett(26--2)
and his daughter Michelle.(26--2)
It's nice to meet you.(26--2)
And this gentleman is my grandfather, Malcolm Stewart.(26--2)
Welcome, Mr. Stewart.(26--2)
Well, make yourselves comfortable.(26--2)
There are hors d'oeuvres at the table, fruit punch at the bar.(26--2)
Help yourselves.(26--2)
Can I get you something, Mr. Stewart?(26--2)
No, thank you. (26--2)
You can feel very proud of your grandson, Mr. Stewart.(26--2)
I do.(26--2)
I'm proud of all my grandchildren, Mr. Carlson.(26--2)
Of course.(26--2)
Feel free to look around.(26--2)
If you need anything, just ask.(26--2)
Thank you.(26--2)
Harvey?(26--2)
Yes?(26--2)
Did Mitchell Johnson's review come out yet?(26--2)
Not yet.(26--2)
The newspapers don't come out till about ten o'clock.(26--2)
When they come out, we'll get it.(26--2)
Thanks.(26--2)
Ready?(26--2)
Yes. Have the people arrived?(26--2)
The guests are waiting.(26--2)
Tom's about to open the doors.(26--2)
Good luck! And stop worrying!(26--2)
They're going to love it.(26--2)
What's this?(26--3)
Read it.(26--3)
I can't.(26--3)
Would you read it, Marilyn?(26--3)
"Richard Stewart's show at the Carlson Gallery "(26--3)
is a collection of photographs(26--3)
from his new book entitled Family Album, U.S.A.(26--3)
There is power and beauty in Mr. Stewart's work,(26--3)
and his book(26--3)
introduces us to a remarkable new talent."(26--3)
Oh, Richard, it's wonderful!(26--3)
Congratulations!(26--3)
Wow! I'm overwhelmed!(26--3)
Ladies and gentlemen,(26--3)
if I may have your attention for a moment, please?(26--3)
I hope you're all enjoying the exhibition.(26--3)
I know that I am.(26--3)
And I would like to introduce the young man(26--3)
who spent the last five years(26--3)
taking these remarkable pictures(26--3)
and writing the background for Family Album,U.S.A.--(26--3)
Mr. Richard Stewart.(26--3)
Hello.(26--3)
I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight.(26--3)
I'd like to thank Harvey Carlson(26--3)
for his faith in my project.(26--3)
But most of all,(26--3)
I would like to thank my family(26--3)
for their love and support all through this adventure.(26--3)
Thank you.(26--3)
Oh, I'm glad that's over.(26--3)
Would you mind?(26--3)
Oh, not at all.(26--3)
Thanks.(26--3)
Our pleasure.(26--3)
Hope it wins a Pulitzer Prize.(26--3)
I'll settle for an "A" in my photography course.(26--3)
Ah, Richard, Marilyn, I want you to meet John O'Neill.(26--3)
Oh, how do you do?(26--3)
Nice to meet you.(26--3)
I've been looking forward to meeting your husband, Mrs. Stewart.(26--3)
I'm really impressed by your show.(26--3)
Thank you.(26--3)
In fact, I'd like your autograph.(26--3)
Oh, well, really ...(26--3)
On a contract.(26--3)
What's this about, Harvey?(26--3)
Mr. O'Neill is the publisher of several magazines.(26--3)
Of course. I've seen you on television.(26--3)
Mr. O'Neill was so impressed with your work(26--3)
that he wants to develop it into a magazine concept.(26--3)
Well, that sounds very exciting,(26--3)
but where would I fit into the plan?(26--3)
I'd like you to be the photo editor of the magazine.(26--3)
Oh, Richard, how exciting!(26--3)
It's a wonderful opportunity, Richard.(26--3)
Hold on. Wait a minute, please.(26--3)
What's the problem, Richard?(26--3)
The problem is that I'm a photographer, not an editor.(26--3)
I like what I do.(26--3)
In fact, I love what I do...(26--3)
which is going out with a camera and a roll of film(26--3)
and seeing the wonder of humanity.(26--3)
Now, I appreciate your offer,(26--3)
but I've worked so hard on Family Album, U.S.A.,(26--3)
and I'm giving some thought to a new book on a different subject.(26--3)
I'm flattered,(26--3)
but I enjoy taking pictures, and I want to continue doing that.(26--3)
Thank you,(26--3)
but I'm happy being a photographer.(26--3)
I understand, Richard.(26--3)
Richard, I know your next book will be a success.(26--3)
Congratulations!(26--3)
Thanks.(26--3)
You're a real Stewart!(26--3)
Thanks.(26--3)
