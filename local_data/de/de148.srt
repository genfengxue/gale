1
00:00:06,466 --> 00:00:08,560
But why not? I'm sixteen.
可是为什么不行? 我都16岁了.

2
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:12,371
That's right. You just turned sixteen.
对呀. 你才刚刚16岁,

3

You've just got your driver's license.
才刚刚拿到驾驶执照,

4
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:20,025
And you are certainly not driving cross-country with a couple of friends for a winter vacation,

5
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,590
because you don't have enough experience.
因为你还没有足够的经验. 

6
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:26,789
How will I ever get the experience if you never let me do anything?
我怎么可能会有经验呢, 如果你什么事情都不让我去做的话. 

7
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,896
I hardly think we are that strict.
我想我们还不至于那么苛刻吧.

8
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:30,148
But, as you say. 
不过,就像你所说的, 

9
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:32,037
you never get to do anything you want.

10
00:00:32,462 --> 00:00:33,051
It's not fair.
这不公平.

11
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:36,271
I'm sorry you feel that way.
你这样想我很遗憾.

12
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,638
OK, I won't drive.
那好吧,我不开车,

13
00:00:40,185 --> 00:00:42,093
Just justine and Sarah will.

And they have been driving for months and months.

15
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:45,173
We would be totally careful.
我们会非常小心的.

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,272
There's nothing to worry about. 
这有什么好担心的. 

17
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,411
Why don't you believe me?
为什么你不相信我呢?

18
00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:53,011
It's not that I don't believe you, Beth.
不是我不相信你, Beth.

19
00:00:53,508 --> 00:00:54,892
But the answer is still no.
但我的答复还是不行.

20
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:55,979
But why?
可是为什么?

21
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:58,837
You may not take this trip because you are all young,
你不可以参加这次旅行, 因为你们年纪都还太轻,

22
00:00:59,547 --> 00:01:01,235
relatively inexperienced driers.
相对来说又没什么驾驶经验.

23
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:03,722
Since you're proposing a winter trip, 
因为你们提出的是冬季旅行,

24
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,478
this is an even more serious consideration.
那我就更得好好考虑考虑了.

25
00:01:08,643 --> 00:01:11,359
We'd be sick with worry. no matter what you tell us.
不管你对我们怎么说, 我们都会担心死的.

26
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:14,332
You're just too wonderful to have around the house.
你这么可爱, 家里没你可不行. 

27
00:01:15,435 --> 00:01:17,073
You're running for your stupid office. 
你在竞选那个愚蠢的官职,

28
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:19,839
You're doing what you want and we have to accommodate you.
你在做你想做的事,我们非得适应你,

29
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,024
But I can't do what I want.
可我就不能做我想做的事.
