but what I truly love are our weekly community newspapers that really focus on the city of Cambridge, which is where I live.

I travel a lot, so whether it's the Miami Herald or the Chicago Tribune or USA Today, doesn't make that much difference.

facts behind the headlines in greater detail than the newspaper sometimes and ahead of the newspaper too.

I think newspapers are the best.

It's more entertainment.

When you pick up newspapers, whether it's, you know, these particular newspapers, 
当你拿起报纸的时候, 不管是哪种报纸, you know, 这些报纸,
