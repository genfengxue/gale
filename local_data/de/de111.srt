or did you keep your own name?

I took Richard's name when we got married.

These days, many women don't.

At the time, it was more trouble to keep my own name than to change it to his.
我们结婚那会儿, 要是不改随夫姓的话会很麻烦的.

17

So we gave mine to our daughter as a middle name.

Oh, it's beautiful.

It sounds like an author's name, doesn't it?

I think it sounds like an attorney's name.

And what does Beth think?

You know the families of candidates are often in the public eye.

Some kids have a hard time with it.

31
00:01:52,747 --> 00:01:53,282
Nancy...

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,194
A minor celebrity.
我是说有点儿小名气的人.

Oh, no, Nancy.
