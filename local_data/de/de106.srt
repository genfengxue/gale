Being a police officer, you have to carry yourself with dignity and pride.
作为一名警官, 你的举止必须体现尊严和自豪感.

I like being with people. I like helping people. 
我喜欢与人打交道. 我喜欢帮助别人.

3
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:26,170
I still see the child today that I delivered some 10 years ago and, er, it was like a bond. 
我仍然经常见到10年前我接生的那个小孩, er, 我们之间仿佛有一条纽带.

We have a very close relationship because the mother spoke to the child and said,

"That's the officer that delivered you years ago."

That was my most rewarding experience. 
那是我收获最大的一次经历.

7

Let me tell you, statistically, most of the people react favorably toward the police.
让我们看看统计数字吧, 大多数人对警察反应良好.

But again, statistically, the firemen are more loved than the police. 
但是统计数字也表明, 消防队员比警察更受喜爱.

00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,250
At one point, when I, we went in, um, the fire started rolling up over the top of us,
当时, 当我, 当我们进去的时候, um, 火苗在我们头上翻卷着,

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,050
so um, they called, they backed everybody out and they hit it with deck guns, 
所以, um, 他们招呼着, 他们护送大家都撤出来, 然后再用灭火枪灭火,

11
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:07,150
and after a while, we were ordered back in, and we went back in and I was going up the stairs,
过了一会儿, 我们奉命进去, 于是我们就又进去了, 我往楼上走, 

12
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,350
and on the way up the stairs I looked up, and, er, 
在上楼的路上, 我向上看, and, er, 

13
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:16,450
it looks like, you know, it looked like, I thought I could see little, er, little holes of light coming through the ceiling,
好像, you know, 好像, 我想我能看见屋顶有小洞漏进光来,

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,850
you know, figuring that, you know, it was burning through. 
you know, 我想, you know, 那是烧穿了.

15
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,750
And then I took a closer look and it actually was completely burned off and they were stars up in the sky. 
然后我仔细看了看, 事实上屋顶全烧穿了, 那些光是天上的星星.

16
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,550
So the whole roof was gone and that was one of the, er, more wild situations that, that I've been in. 
整个屋顶都烧没了. 那是我经历过的比较惊险的一个状况.

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,420
And I was just a couple of weeks, er, on the job. 
而那时, 我才刚干了几个星期.
