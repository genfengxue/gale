1
I think I like being up early.
<k></k>

2
That's a little more relaxed.
<k></k>

3
I have to be here by 5 on weekdays and 4:30 on Sunday,
<k></k>

4
but I, I work four days a week here.
<k></k>

5
I kind of stagger it.
<k></k>

6
Sometimes you lose some sleep but you have to do what you have to do to make a living.
<k></k>

7
I really don't mind coming in early.
<k></k>

8
I, you know, I get in, I get a place to park,
<k></k>

9
I come down, I get some stuff done and,
<k></k>

10
you know, I like walking down the street in the morning.
<k></k>

11
It's kind of like my cup of coffee to get going.
<k></k>

12
Well, I don't have much of a social life right now.
<k></k>

13
I'm just working all the time.
<k></k>

14
I don't go out a lot at night.
<k></k>

15
I, you know, I've got a wife and tow kids,
<k></k>

16
so I spend most of the time with them,
<k></k>

17
and I stay up not overly late.
<k></k>

18
But it does change, you know, I'm a little tired,
<k></k>

19
come, you know, 10 o'clock at night.
<k></k>

20
I'm, you know, I don't have a lot of energy left.
<k></k>

21
I'm here from midnight till 8 in the morning,
<k></k>

22
er, four nights a week; Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday,
<k></k>

23
and it's a great deal of fun
<k></k>

24
because it also gives me four daytimes off each week.
<k></k>

25
The nighttime customers are, for the most part,
<k></k>

26
a little drunk, definitely very hungry,
<k></k>

27
they've spent a lot of money,
<k></k>

28
they're on their way home,
<k></k>

29
they're sleepy, they're tired,
<k></k>

30
they want food with no effort as quickly as humanly possible.
<k></k>

31
The morning people tend to,
<k></k>

32
they want some nice peace and quiet,
<k></k>

33
maybe just get started for the day.
<k></k>

34
They're waking up,
<k></k>

35
they don't want to get blasted
<k></k>

36
and they don't want to walk straight into work,
<k></k>

37
so they come in, they settle down,
<k></k>

38
they have a cup of coffee,
<k></k>

39
they talk about last night's news
<k></k>

40
and then they move on.
<k></k>
