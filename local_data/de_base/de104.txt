Something called "The Jersey devil".
<k></k>

7
Cool.
<k></k>

8
Is that about a couple on a date and they park in the woods or something?
<k></k>

9
Well, according to the story I know, they run out of gas,
<k></k>

10
and they're really nervous because there's an escaped monster in the woods, too.
<k></k>

11
The Jersey devil.
<k></k>

12
Right.
<k></k>

13
They hear a noise and the guy gets out to look around and the woman waits in the car like this.
<k></k>

14
She hears scratching behind the car, in front of the car, and against the roof.
<k></k>

15
And she's scared because of the Jersey devil.
<k></k>

16
Now I remember.
<k></k>

She finally gets out and sees that it was her boyfriend trying to get back into the car.
<k></k>

But the Jersey devil got him.
<k></k>

It's supposed to be true.

Did you hear the one about the baby-sitter and the phone calls?
<k></k>

21
I think so.
<k></k>

22
The creep calls the baby-sitter and calls and calls and won't let her alone,
<k></k>

23
and she finally has the operator trace the phone lines.
<k></k>

24
And the operator calls and says, "Get out now.
<k></k>

25
He's calling from a phone inside the house!"
<k></k>

26
Ahhhgh!
<k></k>

27
Hello.
