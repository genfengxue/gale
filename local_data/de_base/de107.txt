Richard?
<k></k>

2
Over there is fine.
<k></k>

3
Yvonne!
<k></k>

4
I'm almost finished!
<k></k>

5
Believe me, Douglas, Yvonne promised she would take the day off.
<k></k>

6
She said she had done enough work for one week.
<k></k>

7
And now she is in there with a calculator.
<k></k>

8
I know. I know.
<k></k>

9
Douglas, don't be shy.
<k></k>

10
This looks great.
<k></k>

11
It smells fantastic.
<k></k>

12
Dig in. Yvonne!
<k></k>

13
Two seconds!
<k></k>

14
Douglas, Yvonne mentioned you were in Chicago.
<k></k>

15
Yeah. For a seminar on selling commercial property.
<k></k>

16
It was just a couple of days.
<k></k>

17
This is delicious.
<k></k>

18
But the flight back was horrible.
<k></k>

19
We flew through a huge storm.
<k></k>

20
I hate airplanes.
<k></k>

21
You told me you were over that.
<k></k>

22
Not when I hear these stories.
<k></k>

23
This was pretty bad.
<k></k>

24
At one point, the flight attendants told us we had to take crash positions.
<k></k>

25
Oh, my god! You're kidding!
<k></k>

26
No. And then the pilot came on and said we couldn't land.
<k></k>

27
It was absolutely terrifying.
<k></k>

28
Of course, statistically, it's very safe.
<k></k>

29
Tell that to the people in the crash position.
<k></k>

30
Well, to be fair, I lived to tell the story. I am here.
<k></k>

31
But your wife isn't. Yvonne!
<k></k>

32
Yvonne, we ate all the food!
<k></k>

33
There's nothing left. You missed it.
<k></k>
