1
I can't meet them then. I'm in court.
<k></k>

2
You're in court the next day.
<k></k>

3
Right.
<k></k>

4
But I'm also in court on Wednesday.
<k></k>

5
The next day is Wednesday.
<k></k>

6
Trish, we just started and we're already out of sync.
<k></k>

7
I cannot have all these meetings.
<k></k>

8
There aren't enough hours in the day.
<k></k>

9
With all due respect,
<k></k>

10
you don't write things down in the calendar.
<k></k>

11
So I don't know how full your schedule is,
<k></k>

12
which is why we still have these little meetings.
<k></k>

13
Can we agree that the day after Wednesday is Thursday?
<k></k>

14
That's a joke, Trish. A little joke.
<k></k>

15
May we start from the beginning?
<k></k>

16
By all means.
<k></k>

17
The Credit Card Association would like to meet with you on Tuesday morning.
<k></k>

18
Fine. I can do it in the morning.
<k></k>

19
Afterwards, I'm in court.
<k></k>

20
Fine. Which case?
<k></k>

21
People vs Kenton.
<k></k>

22
That case doesn't start until next week!
<k></k>

23
We're talking about next week!
<k></k>

24
We're talking about this week!
<k></k>

25
Trish, I said, "Let's talk about next week."
<k></k>

26
You said it on Friday.
<k></k>

27
Last week, "next week" means "this week" this week.
<k></k>

28
You're going to make a very good attorney.
<k></k>
