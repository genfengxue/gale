1
OK. I'll tell him you called.
<k></k>

2
Hey, that was Lisa.
<k></k>

3
She said you were supposed to meet her.
<k></k>

4
I know. I was. Was she mad?
<k></k>

5
Was she mad!
<k></k>

6
Oh boy, I blew it.
<k></k>

7
Well, she said she was going home and she'd call you later.
<k></k>

8
What happened?
<k></k>

9
I taped in the Square this morning.
<k></k>

10
Then I had a meeting over at school with my advisor.
<k></k>

11
First of all, he was 45 minutes late.
<k></k>

12
Then after a complete progress report, he decides to go over the whole project from the top.
<k></k>

13
What a pain!
<k></k>

14
I wanted to just get up and walk out.
<k></k>

15
Temper, Michael. He is your graduate advisor.
<k></k>

16
Lisa will calm down.
<k></k>

17
It's nothing a little gesture on your part won't fix.
<k></k>

18
Ask her to marry you.
<k></k>

19
Let's not go to extremes.
<k></k>

20
Tell her it'll never happen again.
<k></k>

21
I told her that the last time.
<k></k>

22
Well well well, you do have a problem, don't you?
<k></k>

23
I could grovel.
<k></k>

24
Groveling is an option. Now, personally I don't grovel.
<k></k>

25
I just inspire women to break up with me.
<k></k>

26
Maybe you should try groveling.
<k></k>
