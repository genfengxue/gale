1
The kinds of weather that I like best, I think the best time a year is the fall,
<k></k>

2
that time a year where the air is crisp and cool and it seems to be cleaner.
<k></k>

3
Spring is my favourite kind of weather.
<k></k>

4
I like this weather. Today is a perfect day.
<k></k>

5
Not too hot, not too cool, you can do things outside.
<k></k>

6
We live, unfortunately, in Washington D. C. which has sort of two weathers: bad and hot.
<k></k>

7
Winter, a little bit of winter but not really, and then mostly very, very hot summer.
<k></k>

8
I love the autumn here, and actually the past couple of years we've been having really nice falls.
<k></k>

9
I usually watch the weather channel.
<k></k>

10
The paper. On the news. Yes, news, weather channel.
<k></k>

11
I like to watch them when they give you the weather report showing the map of the whole country
<k></k>

12
and you can then see the weather systems, weather moving.
<k></k>

13
I look at the newspaper and then l look outside and see, er, which, which is a better predictor.
<k></k>

14
There's a free weather, er, phone number that you can call for like a recorded weather forecast and I call probably two or three times a day.
<k></k>

15
I do. I have to know what to wear, you know.
<k></k>

16
It changes so quickly that it doesn't really matter what the weather forecasts say.
<k></k>

17
If I wake up in the morning needing to go to work and it's raining, that, kind of dampens my spirits a little bit.
<k></k>

18
I think if it's a nice, crisp, cool morning, the sun is shining, you feel, you feel bright and cheery yourself.
<k></k>

19
The sun is very energizing.
<k></k>

20
I couldn't live somewhere where it's rainy or cold all the time.
<k></k>

21
When it's hot and humid in Washington, we don't want to do anything and,
<k></k>

22
you know, I think yesterday was a really rainy, you know, overcast day, everybody was a little down.
<k></k>

23
Today it's beautiful, so we're all up again.
<k></k>
