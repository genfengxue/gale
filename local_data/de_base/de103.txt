What do you think?
<k></k>

2
I think something's caught in here.
<k></k>

3
I mean, what do you think of running?
<k></k>

4
For office?
<k></k>

5
No, Boston Marathon. Yes, for office.
<k></k>

6
I'm not sure. I love my job.
<k></k>

7
But, I've been there for eight years.
<k></k>

8
Maybe it's time to move on.
<k></k>

9
Maybe it's time for a new job.
<k></k>

10
Ah, but you won't know you have this job until the election.
<k></k>

11
True. You know, the thought of public office never occurred to me.
<k></k>

12
But ever since Constanza's phone call, it's been on my mind.
<k></k>

13
What do you think?
<k></k>

14
I don't think that goes there.
<k></k>

15
Isn't the belt supposed to go there?
<k></k>

16
Well, I think it's very exciting.
<k></k>

17
But I'm worried too.
<k></k>

18
I mean, this will have an enormous effect on all of us.
<k></k>

19
For instance, our lives will certainly change during a campaign.
<k></k>

20
Are you listening?
<k></k>

21
For instance, our lives will certainly change during a campaign.
<k></k>

22
You're doing it again.
<k></k>

23
What?
<k></k>

24
You repeat what I say, but you don't really hear it.
<k></k>

25
Sweetheart, you think I can't hear unless I look at you.
<k></k>

26
But in fact, I use my ears to listen, not my eyes.
<k></k>

27
I can even hear you with my eyes closed.
<k></k>

28
Go ahead. Say something.
<k></k>

29
You're impossible.
<k></k>

30
I'm impossible. See?
<k></k>
