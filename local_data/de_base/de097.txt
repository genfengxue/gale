1
A live performance as in a band or something,
<k></k>

2
so that's like a hundred times better.
<k></k>

3
I mean, you just get, you get to feel the music and be part of it.
<k></k>

4
Sometimes it's nice to have more than two or three people.
<k></k>

5
Sometimes it's nice when you get a big group of people
<k></k>

6
it can charge you and make you feel like you know why you're there.
<k></k>

7
I think people like the theater just 'cause the feeling of going out and,
<k></k>

8
you know, preparing for it, sort of, and relax and you go and get something to eat.
<k></k>

9
Movies are the most common 'cause they're the most around, but I like going to plays.
<k></k>

10
Yeah, I've been to comedy clubs.
<k></k>

11
I enjoy them, if I like the show.
<k></k>

12
And I enjoy taking in different cultures, going to different plays
<k></k>

13
I also watch a lot of movies and stand-up comedy and, ah, stuff like that, that's pretty much where I go.
<k></k>

14
You're seeing something that's for real,
<k></k>

15
versus something that's processed that,
<k></k>

16
you know, would be the same if you saw it again and again and again;
<k></k>

17
if you saw the same movie,
<k></k>

18
it's going to be the same next time I see it.
<k></k>

19
I've been to a couple professional theaters and er, I do like the theater, it's very good.
<k></k>

20
I do a magic act, and about a 15-minute show and just have fun doing that.
<k></k>

21
I try to come out every day, depending on the weather.
<k></k>

22
I usually change my act, I'd say, each year.
<k></k>

23
You know, I pretty much, er, spend the winter designing it,
<k></k>

24
putting it together and studying what I want to do
<k></k>

25
and, you know, some, it takes me, er,about a year to think about what I want to do and how to change it.
<k></k>

26
So I picked up his guitar and I played the three chords that I knew, D, A, G,
<k></k>

27
and while I was strumming someone came along
<k></k>

28
and threw a pound coin in the case
<k></k>

29
and this light bulb went off in my head and I said, you konw,
<k></k>

30
why am I studying engineering and production when I can maybe do this myself.
<k></k>
