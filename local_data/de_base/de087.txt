1
Where do I like to shop?
<k></k>

2
Shopping is not my, my sport.
<k></k>

3
I, I am really not the guy to talk about shopping.
<k></k>

4
I have a daughter who's 12.
<k></k>

5
and I found I enjoy shopping with her now.
<k></k>

6
She's getting old enough.
<k></k>

7
We like similar things or we like totally opposite things,
<k></k>

8
but it's fun together.
<k></k>

9
If we can find a mall that isn't as crowded,
<k></k>

10
we'll go there,
<k></k>

11
but most of the time we go to neighborhood shops.
<k></k>

12
Sometimes I like to shop.
<k></k>

13
Usually I prefer shopping from catalogs than going to the mall.
<k></k>

14
because there are too many people.
<k></k>

15
Who shops for my clothes?
<k></k>

16
Er, I shop for my own clothes.
<k></k>

17
I only shop when I need something.
<k></k>

18
I don't shop for pleasure.
<k></k>

19
When we were younger, shopping was our recreation,
<k></k>

20
but now I do what I have to do and I don't do it any other time.
<k></k>

21
I'm a real bohemian, so we've been married for six years
<k></k>

22
and I don't think I've bought any of my own clothes in six years, if that answers your question.
<k></k>

23
Automotive parts.
<k></k>

24
I'm big on automotive parts, sometimes.
<k></k>

25
The food shopping.
<k></k>

26
My wife does all the food shopping.
<k></k>

27
I'm from Frankfurt, Germany, and we have a flea market every week, um, near the river.
<k></k>

28
I like to buy there.
<k></k>

29
Sometimes I go shopping even if I don't want to find anything myself.
<k></k>

30
If a friend needs something, we just walk around and look at clothes
<k></k>

31
and you know, and talk and hang out, sometimes it is a social activity.
<k></k>

32
I prefer, er, family-owned small businesses
<k></k>

33
'cause I think, um,
<k></k>

34
there's a much more human quality involved in shopping in those stores.
<k></k>

35
I think it's vital to, to keep those kind of community centers going.
<k></k>

36
I think the biggest mistake they've made in all around the world is they think that centralizing shopping has become something that makes sense.
<k></k>
