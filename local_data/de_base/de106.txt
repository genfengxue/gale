1
Being a police officer, you have to carry yourself with dignity and pride.
<k></k>

2
I like being with people. I like helping people.
<k></k>

3
I still see the child today that I delivered some 10 years ago and, er, it was like a bond.
<k></k>

4
We have a very close relationship because the mother spoke to the child and said,
<k></k>

5
"That's the officer that delivered you years ago."
<k></k>

6
That was my most rewarding experience.
<k></k>

7
Let me tell you, statistically, most of the people react favorably toward the police.
<k></k>

8
But again, statistically, the firemen are more loved than the police.
<k></k>

9
At one point, when I, we went in, um, the fire started rolling up over the top of us,
<k></k>

10
so um, they called, they backed everybody out and they hit it with deck guns,
<k></k>

11
and after a while, we were ordered back in, and we went back in and I was going up the stairs,
<k></k>

12
and on the way up the stairs I looked up, and, er,
<k></k>

13
it looks like, you know, it looked like, I thought I could see little, er, little holes of light coming through the ceiling,
<k></k>

14
you know, figuring that, you know, it was burning through.
<k></k>

15
And then I took a closer look and it actually was completely burned off and they were stars up in the sky.
<k></k>

16
So the whole roof was gone and that was one of the, er, more wild situations that, that I've been in.
<k></k>

17
And I was just a couple of weeks, er, on the job.
<k></k>
