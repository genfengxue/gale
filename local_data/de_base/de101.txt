Hi... Danny?
<k></k>

2
Hi Nancy. Hi. How are you?
<k></k>

3
Fine, thanks. Nice tuxedo.
<k></k>

4
I'm... I'm... I'm going to a wedding.
<k></k>

5
For a minute there, you looked like one of those balloon-delivery guys.
<k></k>

6
The balloons are for the wedding.
<k></k>

7
Oh.
<k></k>

8
The couple is Danish, and the Danes have an old custom.
<k></k>

9
Actually, it's not that old, but the balloons are part of it.
<k></k>

10
Part of the wedding.
<k></k>

11
Yes.
<k></k>

12
Everybody has something.
<k></k>

13
Americans throw birdseed.
<k></k>

14
The Japanese have rubber cakes.
<k></k>

15
In Liechtenstein, they kidnap the bride from the reception.
<k></k>

16
... Or is that the Zimbabweans?
<k></k>

17
You know, Nancy, I was just on my way out.
<k></k>

18
Of course. Don't let me keep you.
<k></k>

19
You don't want to be late for a wedding, especially if you're in the bridal party.
<k></k>

20
Are you the best man?
<k></k>

21
No. Yes. Sort of. Nice talking to you. Bye.
<k></k>
