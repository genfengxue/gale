Hey,you know?
There's still some film left on this roll,
and there's one person I haven't photographed in a long time.
Who?
You.

You look great!
It's not fair, Richard. 
I'm not even ready.
Oh, that's wonderful! That's wonderful!

Like them? They represent your best work.
Really?
Absolutely.
Well...what do you think? Do I have my book?
You do. You do. There's a book here.
I'll have a contract and an advance payment waiting for you first thing in the morning.
Thank you.
And while you're here, I would like to introduce you to your editor.
And I want you to meet the people in the art department.
I'll set up an appointment with the marketing people.
When do you think we'll be through?
In about half an hour. Why?
I can't wait to tell Marilyn!
