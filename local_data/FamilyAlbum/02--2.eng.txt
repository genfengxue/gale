And there's a phone call for you, Mr. Bennett.
Excuse me, Susan.

Please forgive me, Susan, but...
I have to leave. I feel terrible, but...
What's the matter?
My daughter isn't feeling well.
Oh no! Is it serious?
I don't know. The baby-sitter says she has a stomachache,
and she's crying.
I'll have to go home.
Will you forgive me?
Of course. I'm so sorry for Michelle.
And you didn't have a chance to eat.

I hope your daughter is all right. Good-bye.
