There is a way, Malcolm.(23--2)
We get our friends to roll their sleeves up and get to work.(23--2)
It's certainly a good idea.(23--2)
If I could take a look at the place,(23--2)
I could probably tell what it requires to fix it up.(23--2)
How much paint, how many hours of work...(23--2)
That's what I came to ask you to do, Malcolm.(23--2)
If you would supervise the refurbishing,(23--2)
I'll find the people to help do it.(23--2)
I'll help too, Mr. Baker.(23--2)
I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood(23--2)
and collect the furniture we need.(23--2)
I'll help.(23--2)
Tomorrow. Yes. We'll meet tomorrow morning, right here.(23--2)
Can we help?(23--2)
I'd really like to.(23--2)
Sure.(23--2)
We might need you to come through with your friends, Robbie.(23--2)
Not just to go around the neighborhood asking for furniture,(23--2)
but to help with the paint job.(23--2)
That's backbreaking work and may be too much for us.(23--2)
I'll do it. I'll talk to them.(23--2)
And tomorrow morning we'll all meet here to discuss the plan?(23--2)
Tomorrow morning it is.(23--2)
Come in,come in.Please,come in.(23--2)
I'd like you to meet my friend Malcolm Stewart.(23--2)
Malcolm, this is Joanne Thompson.(23--2)
Hello, Joanne. Nice to meet you.(23--2)
My pleasure, Malcolm.(23--2)
And this is Abe Lucas. You must remember Abe.(23--2)
He ran the drugstore(23--2)
and used to play drums with the jazz band on weekends.(23--2)
Oh, sure I do. Hi, Abe.(23--2)
Hello, Mr. Stewart.(23--2)
Malcolm, please.(23--2)
Hello, Malcolm.(23--2)
Sit down, sit down. Have some coffee.(23--2)
And I've got some delicious Danish pastry for you.(23--2)
Where's your grandson Robbie and his friend Alexandra?(23--2)
Weren't they going to be here this morning?(23--2)
I thought so, too.(23--2)
I'm surprised they're not here.(23--2)
Robbie left early this morning to meet Alexandra.(23--2)
Frankly, I thought they'd be here, but...(23--2)
It's OK. I'm sure they meant well,(23--2)
but they probably had other things on their minds.(23--2)
I understand you used to be in the construction business,(23--2)
Malcolm.(23--2)
I was, indeed.(23--2)
I wonder if you would take a look at the old library(23--2)
and make sure that it is in good condition(23--2)
so that we don't have to worry about any structural problems.(23--2)
When can I do that? I'd be happy to.(23--2)
We've got permission to go inside the old building(23--2)
during the week--(23--2)
Tuesday or Wednesday.(23--2)
That's fine with me. I can do it either day.(23--2)
That would be very helpful.(23--2)
I think the building just needs a good cleaning.(23--2)
And a good paint job.(23--2)
Then we have to furnish it.(23--2)
I wish Robbie and Alexandra had come to this meeting.(23--2)
They had some ideas about getting the place fixed up.(23--2)
Perhaps they'll show up. In the meantime,(23--2)
let me give you some additional thoughts and ideas I have.(23--2)
OK.(23--2)
Go ahead, Joanne.(23--2)
As I said, mostly the building just needs a good cleaning.(23--2)
This place can be developed(23--2)
with one real intergenerational program.(23--2)
That's an idea I like.(23--2)
A community center(23--2)
with the kinds of programs that fit everyone.(23--2)
And programs that don't leave anyone out.(23--2)
It's asking a lot.(23--2)
But we can't do it without talking to the young people.(23--2)
Finding out what they want.(23--2)
If only Robbie and Alexandra were here.(23--2)
Don't be upset, Malcolm.(23--2)
We'll have a chance to talk to them later.(23--2)
It's not like Robbie.(23--2)
If he says he's going to be here, he's here.(23--2)
I wonder what the problem is.(23--2)
