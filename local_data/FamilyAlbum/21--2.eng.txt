Hello. Hello there.(21--2)
Are you ready for lunch with your grandpa?(21--2)
Oh!Hi,Grandpa.Yes,of course,I am,but my mind isn't.(21--2)
What's the matter, Susan?(21--2)
A real dilemma.(21--2)
Does it have anything to do with you and Harry?(21--2)
Yes,but I don't know where to start.(21--2)
Maybe I can help.Tell me what it is,Susan.(21--2)
Thanks, Grandpa. Please sit down.(21--2)
Oh! Harry has been offered a job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
Well, this is something to think about.(21--2)
There are so many things to consider. There's Michelle.(21--2)
I wonder if a move would be a bad thing for her. And my job.(21--2)
I don't know if I can get a good job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
And what about our family?(21--2)
Can I tell you what I think?(21--2)
Tell me.(21--2)
I think that you're very successful(21--2)
and that you have a fantastic reputation in the toy industry.(21--2)
I think you could talk to Mr. Marchetta,(21--2)
and I think(21--2)
he could help you find a real good job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
He was very helpful to me, remember?(21--2)
I suppose I could call him.(21--2)
But I'm not so sure that I want to leave New York,(21--2)
you, and the rest of our family.(21--2)
Well, I'm not going to kid you, Susan.(21--2)
You know we'd all miss you.(21--2)
But this should be your decision.(21--2)
It's something that only you and Harry can work out.(21--2)
If moving to L.A. is in Harry's best interest,(21--2)
I have to do what I can do to support him.(21--2)
In every marriage,(21--2)
sacrifices have to be made by one partner from time to time.(21--2)
And what about Michelle?(21--2)
Well, what do you think?(21--2)
I think Michelle is better off staying where she is.(21--2)
What does she think?(21--2)
I don't know for sure.(21--2)
Well, you'll have to ask her.(21--2)
I think I'm going to have a talk with Mr. Marchetta(21--2)
and get his feelings about my leaving.(21--2)
And about helping me find a job in Los Angeles.(21--2)
Good idea.(21--2)
I'll call him right now. No point in delaying.(21--2)
Thanks, Grandpa.(21--2)
Harry, it's the perfect job for you. You'll love it.(21--2)
It's a big decision for me, Bill.(21--2)
And I have to discuss it with my wife.(21--2)
I don't know if it's right for her.(21--2)
She'll love it.It's a once-in-a-lifetime offer,Harry.(21--2)
OK. Tell it to me again.(21--2)
The company is Craft and Craft,(21--2)
the biggest accounting company in the country.(21--2)
I know the company well. It's big.(21--2)
The biggest.(21--2)
Yeah,yeah.The biggest.When do I have to let you know?(21--2)
Talk it over. Think it over. Let me know by the end of the week.(21--2)
When would we have to move?(21--2)
As soon as possible.(21--2)
I also have my daughter to consider.(21--2)
I don't want to interrupt her school year.(21--2)
Let me know by the end of the week.(21--2)
It's a great opportunity for you, Harry.(21--2)
Believe me.(21--2)
I know.(21--2)
Craft and Craft is the biggest in the country.(21--2)
Yeah, I know. The biggest.(21--2)
I think Michelle is asleep now. Let's talk.(21--2)
I met with Bill York today.(21--2)
And I talked with Mr. Marchetta. Did York make the offer?(21--2)
Yup. He asked me if I want the job.(21--2)
That's exciting, Harry. What was it?(21--2)
A vice-presidency(21--2)
with the biggest accounting company in the country-(21--2)
Craft and Craft.(21--2)
Aren't you excited about that?(21--2)
Sure I am. But there's so much more to consider.(21--2)
I talked to Mr. Marchetta.(21--2)
What did he say? Did you tell him about me?(21--2)
Of course,Harry.I want what's best for you,(21--2)
and I think I can get a good job(21--2)
through Mr. Marchetta(21--2)
in Los Angeles also.(21--2)
You're kidding.(21--2)
No, I'm not kidding.(21--2)
I talked with him, and he understands completely.(21--2)
He has a major toy buyer in Los Angeles,(21--2)
and he's pretty sure that I can get a good job there.(21--2)
Unbelievable!(21--2)
But I think we should talk to Michelle about all of this.(21--2)
You're right. We'll talk to her about it.(21--2)
And how do you feel about taking the job in Los Angeles?(21--2)
How should I feel?(21--2)
It's the biggest company in the country.(21--2)
Well,then you feel good about taking it?(21--2)
Well ... I feel fine about it. Why shouldn't I?(21--2)
