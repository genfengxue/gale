I really like this one Susan. Do you?(21--1)
Turn around,Michelle.Let me see the back of it.(21--1)
I like it a lot. It fits well.(21--1)
It doesn't need any alterations.We must've bought the right size.(21--1)
I like the color. She looks good in blue.(21--1)
I like blue, too, Daddy.(21--1)
Try on the skirt and blouse outfit,Michelle--(21--1)
the one that Daddy wanted you to wear.(21--1)
OK.(21--1)
Michelle has been a different kid since we've been married.(21--1)
She's never been happier.(21--1)
And I've never been happier,Harry.(21--1)
I love her very much. She's been a joy.(21--1)
We're very lucky, the three of us...(21--1)
and becoming part of the Stewart family,too.(21--1)
We couldn't ask for anything more, could we?(21--1)
Well...(21--1)
Well...?Could we ask for anything more?(21--1)
Well...we...(21--1)
How do you like it, Daddy?(21--1)
It's my favorite outfit.(21--1)
It's good for every day. It will be good for school, Michelle.(21--1)
I like it, too. I always like skirts that go like this.(21--1)
Do you want to see the winter jacket on me,Susan?(21--1)
Yes, I do. Change back into your jeans,(21--1)
and put on the new winter jacket we bought today.(21--1)
OK.(21--1)
What did you mean by "well ...?"(21--1)
You had something on your mind(21--1)
when I said we couldn't ask for anything more.(21--1)
Is everything all right?(21--1)
Everything is fine,Michelle.(21--1)
Let's take a look at the winter jacket.Come on over here,honey.(21--1)
It's kind of warm.(21--1)
It is. That's why we bought it for you.(21--1)
This will be a perfect jacket for the wintertime(21--1)
when it's very cold out.(21--1)
But it's kind of small also. We must've bought the wrong size.(21--1)
Looks like we should've bought a bigger one.(21--1)
I guess we'll have to exchange it,too.(21--1)
I'm sure the store has others.(21--1)
I look silly!It is too small!(21--1)
You're growing so fast, Michelle.(21--1)
Can I take it off? I'm hot!(21--1)
Sure. Put it back in your room, and we'll hang everything up later.(21--1)
Well,are you going to tell me what's on your mind, Harry?(21--1)
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company(21--1)
in Los Angeles.(21--1)
I have been offered a job with a major accounting company(21--1)
in Los Angeles.(21--1)
Los Angeles? That's a big decision.(21--1)
I know. It will also affect you and your job, if we decide to go.(21--1)
Wow!It sure will.But first tell me about the job, Harry.(21--1)
If it's a good one, then we'll make it work for us.(21--1)
I have a client in the garment business, on Seventh Avenue.(21--1)
I do his taxes every year.(21--1)
He has a big sales office in Los Angeles,(21--1)
and the company in Los Angeles(21--1)
that does his major accounting work(21--1)
is looking for an executive. And he recommended me.(21--1)
That's wonderful, Harry.(21--1)
Yes, but it would mean that we'd have to move to L.A.(21--1)
What about the salary?(21--1)
The real discussion comes tomorrow.(21--1)
Susan, I don't plan to make any decisions Susan(21--1)
until I have a chance to talk with you about it.(21--1)
I understand, Harry.(21--1)
And I don't have to make a quick decision.(21--1)
They know that I'm married and that I have a family.(21--1)
Well, there's a lot to think about.(21--1)
If it's a good job,(21--1)
then I've got to do some thinking about(21--1)
my career opportunities in Los Angeles.(21--1)
Is everything OK?(21--1)
Yes, honey.(21--1)
(21--1)
(21--1)
