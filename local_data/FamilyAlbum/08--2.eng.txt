Carl, now you know charades.
Why don't you join us?
I don't like charades.
It's for babies.
Oh, I like it.
Well, they're babies.
You're a sore loser.
Yeah.
No arguing.
Save your voices.
Between now and tomorrow
you're all going to have your tonsils out.
And you won't be able to speak for a while.
So save your voices till then.
Hi, gang. Hi, everybody.
Well, what's going on?
I sure I am glad to see you, Dr. Stewart.
This is a rough group.
I didn't want to play charades,
so they're angry at me.
Why don't you want to play?
Because I don't want to be here.
I don't want my tonsils out.
Why not?
Because my birthday is tomorrow.
My mother promised me a birthday party with a clown.
But you can have one when you go home, Carl.
But my birthday is tomorrow.
I'm sorry, Carl.
Carl, you'll have your party when you go home,
But it won't be on my birthday!
And you promised me a surprise.
