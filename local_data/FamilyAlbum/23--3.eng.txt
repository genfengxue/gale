Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.(23--3)
But Alexandra and I(23--3)
have been busy at work this morning(23--3)
on the community-center project.(23--3)
And we brought someone along who can help.(23--3)
You remember Charles Maxwell, Grandpa?(23--3)
He's the editor of the Riverdale paper.(23--3)
He wrote some nice articles on Mom(23--3)
when she was running for the school board.(23--3)
Yes, I remember. You were a great help.(23--3)
Hi, Mr. Stewart.(23--3)
Hope to be a bigger help on the new community-center project.(23--3)
From what Robbie and Alexandra have told me,(23--3)
you people are making one big story.(23--3)
Let me introduce you, Mr. Maxwell.(23--3)
This is Nat Baker,(23--3)
who's responsible for this meeting,(23--3)
and this is Joanne Thompson--and Abe Lucas,(23--3)
who used to run the drugstore in town.(23--3)
Robbie and Alexandra told me(23--3)
what you need to fix up the old library.(23--3)
I am planning to write an editorial that I think will help you.(23--3)
Let's go. What are your questions?(23--3)
OK.Now,I have...first...a couple of questions here.(23--3)
Have you talked to the community council?(23--3)
And have you had an engineer come in to do an inspection?(23--3)
OK, what do you need most of all?(23--3)
People power.(23--3)
Men and women, young and old, to give us their time.(23--3)
To do what?(23--3)
To help scrub the building interior clean.(23--3)
So that we can repaint it.(23--3)
And you also need bodies to do repainting?(23--3)
That's right.(23--3)
And we'll also need some ladders(23--3)
and some brushes and some paint.(23--3)
When do you need the volunteers,(23--3)
and where do they report?(23--3)
I've got the council to agree(23--3)
to open the building for us on the next four weekends.(23--3)
How about furnishings?(23--3)
Are there any special requirements that I should list in the paper?(23--3)
Yes.(23--3)
Here is a copy of all the things we need to start with.(23--3)
Let's see. Four desks.(23--3)
Eight straight-back chairs. Thirty folding chairs.(23--3)
Six table lamps. Three end tables. One piano.(23--3)
This is a good start.(23--3)
These items shouldn't be difficult to come by(23--3)
once I print the article in the paper.(23--3)
This community has always been very generous.(23--3)
I agree, Mr. Maxwell.(23--3)
What you're saying is, in order for this center to succeed,(23--3)
we need to put together volunteers(23--3)
from the various generations of future users.(23--3)
That's right.(23--3)
And without their energy and stamina,(23--3)
there's no way we can complete this project.(23--3)
I've got it. Now give me some information about(23--3)
how you see the building being used.(23--3)
Oh, here. On the ground floor we have the reception area...(23--3)
It's here, Robbie.(23--3)
Charles Maxwell lived up to his word.(23--3)
"At the Stewart family home on Linden Street yesterday,(23--3)
a group of caring Riverdale citizens gathered(23--3)
to plan the refurbishing of the old library(23--3)
to transform it into a new community center.(23--3)
The original plan by the council(23--3)
was tabled because of lack of funds.(23--3)
The new plan needs you.(23--3)
You could call it a community unity plan.(23--3)
It needs your time, and it needs your energy.(23--3)
And it needs your contributions of furniture,(23--3)
paint, brushes, ladders, lamps, et cetera.(23--3)
A list of these items and a volunteer form(23--3)
can be picked up at the Riverdale Press offices.(23--3)
By working together,(23--3)
this community can do anything to benefit its citizens,(23--3)
and we know you will all work together(23--3)
towards refurbishing the old library(23--3)
and making it a new community center.(23--3)
Charles Maxwell, Editor."(23--3)
